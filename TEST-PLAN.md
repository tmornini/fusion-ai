# Fusion AI — Test Plan

> **Encoding:** `- [ ]` = pending, `- [ ]` = PASS, `- [FAIL]` = failure (add note)

### Protocol

All sections are executed over HTTP — build with
`./build --no-zip /tmp/fusion-test/` and serve via
`cd /tmp/fusion-test/ && python3 -m http.server 8080`.

### Execution Order

Sections A through AA establish a pristine environment and populate
it with data through the UI. Sections B through J then verify every
page renders correctly against that data. The plan is designed to
run as a single continuous regression pass.

## A. Build & Setup

- [ ] **A1** Run `./build` from a clean working directory. PASS: exits 0, prints no errors, creates `~/Desktop/fusion-ai-<sha>.zip`.
- [ ] **A2** Run `./build --no-zip /tmp/fusion-test/`. PASS: `/tmp/fusion-test/` contains `assets/app.js`, `assets/styles.css`, `assets/` (*.woff2 fonts), `index.html`, and 13 page directories containing 23 HTML page files, plus root `index.html`.
- [ ] **A3** Start an HTTP server from the build directory (`cd /tmp/fusion-test/ && python3 -m http.server 8080`). PASS: server starts without errors.
- [ ] **A4** Open `http://localhost:8080/` in the test browser. PASS: redirects to `snapshots/index.html` when no data exists, or `landing/index.html` (which auto-redirects to `dashboard/index.html` after ~2 seconds) when data has been loaded.
- [ ] **A5** Open DevTools Console and confirm no JavaScript errors on initial load. PASS: console is clean (warnings from browser extensions are acceptable).

## AA. Data Entry Workflow

This section populates a pristine environment with all data
through the UI. Each step creates data that later steps depend
on. Run these in order.

### AA1. Create Pristine Environment

- [ ] **AA1** Navigate to `snapshots/`. Click "Create Pristine Environment" and confirm the wipe dialog. PASS: redirects to dashboard. Dashboard shows empty/minimal state.

### AA7. Approve Ideas & Convert to Projects

- [ ] **AA28** On Ideas list, filter by "In Review". Click idea #1. PASS: navigates to idea detail with approval footer.
- [ ] **AA29** Click "Approve". PASS: idea status changes to approved, confirmation shown.
- [ ] **AA30** Approve idea #4 as well (it was submitted for review in AA19). Leave others in their current status. PASS: statuses match mock data (2 approved, rest in-review/active).
- [ ] **AA31** Navigate to approved idea #1. Click "Convert". PASS: conversion form loads with 5 required fields (Project Name, Lead, Start Date, End Date, Cost).
- [ ] **AA32** Fill all required fields: Project Name, select "Sarah Chen" as project lead, Start Date, Target End Date, Cost. Click "Create Project". PASS: navigates to project detail for the new project.

- [ ] **AA34** Approve remaining ideas (7, 8, 9, 10) from Ideas list (filter by "In Review"), then convert all 6 approved ideas to projects. PASS: Projects list shows all 6 with correct status and progress.

### AA9. Create Flows

- [ ] **AA35** Navigate to Projects. Click into
  project #1 detail (status: approved). PASS:
  a "Flows" section is visible showing "No
  flows yet" empty state and a "New Flow"
  button. Non-approved projects show an info
  badge "Approve to add flows" instead of
  the button, and empty state reads "Flow
  creation limited to approved projects only".
- [ ] **AA36** Click "New Flow". PASS: navigates
  to the flow designer page. The SVG canvas
  shows two nodes: "Start" (start, top-left with
  green border) and "End" (end, bottom-right
  with double green border) connected by no edges.
  Toolbar shows Undo, Redo, Delete (trash icon),
  Auto Layout, Zoom −/Show All/+,
  Copy Mermaid, Export. Changes auto-save
  (no explicit Save button).
- [ ] **AA37** Drag the port circle on the start
  node into empty canvas past 20 pixels. PASS:
  during the drag a ghost "New State" card
  follows the cursor along with a faint bezier
  preview. On release, a new node appears at the
  drop position with a blue border,
  auto-connected from the start by an edge with
  a default name. The start node is also
  draggable by its body.
- [ ] **AA38** Double-click the new blue-bordered
  node. PASS: properties panel appears showing
  State Name input, Description input, empty
  Fields list, and outgoing transitions. The
  node gets a blue glow selection effect on the
  canvas.
- [ ] **AA39** Edit the state name in the
  properties panel to "Data Capture". PASS: the
  node label updates on the canvas immediately
  (auto-saves via 800ms debounce).
- [ ] **AA40** Double-click the edge between
  start and "Data Capture". PASS: no properties
  panel opens — the outgoing edge from Start is
  intentionally not interactive. The edge has no
  name label visible on the canvas, just a plain
  blue arrow.
- [ ] **AA41** Drag from "Data Capture"'s port
  into empty canvas past 20 pixels to create a
  new middle node; rename it "Review" via its
  properties panel. Rename the new edge
  "submit".
- [ ] **AA42** Hold Shift and drag from "Review"
  onto "Data Capture". PASS: during the drag the
  preview redraws as a dashed-orange curved
  bezier because a forward path "Data Capture" →
  "Review" already exists, and the reachability
  check recognises the release would close a
  loop. Release to create the cycle edge; rename
  it "needs revision". Hold Shift and drag from
  "Review" onto "End". PASS: preview is a
  solid-blue curved bezier (no return path).
  Release to create the edge; rename it
  "approve".
- [ ] **AA43** In the "Data Capture" properties
  panel, click "+ Add Field". Enter name "Company
  Name", type "text", check "Required". PASS:
  field appears in the fields list with a "text"
  badge and a red asterisk (*) required indicator.
- [ ] **AA44** Add more fields to "Data Capture":
  Contact Email (email, required), Industry (select
  with options "Technology, Finance, Healthcare"),
  Company Logo (image). PASS: all fields appear
  with correct type badges.
- [ ] **AA45** Wait for auto-save (800ms debounce).
  Navigate away and back. PASS: all nodes, edges,
  and fields persist.

### AA10. Verify Dashboard

- [ ] **AA46** Navigate to Dashboard. PASS: gauge
  cards (Time, Cost, Impact) show aggregated values
  computed from the entered project data.
- [ ] **AA47** Header stats reflect entered data
  counts (ideas, projects, flows). PASS:
  counts are non-zero and match.

### AA11. Edit & Verify Cycle

- [ ] **AA48** Edit idea #1: change title. Save,
  navigate to ideas list, return to detail. PASS:
  changed title persists.
- [ ] **AA49** Edit project #1: change description.

  description persists.
- [ ] **AA50** Edit flow: navigate to flow
  designer, rename a state (auto-saves). Navigate
  away, return. PASS: changed state name persists.
- [ ] **AA52** Edit profile: change phone number.
  Save, navigate away, return. PASS: changed phone
  persists.
- [ ] **AA53** Edit company settings: change
  timezone. Save, navigate away, return. PASS:
  changed timezone persists.

### AA12. Snapshot Round-Trip

- [ ] **AA54** Navigate to Snapshots. Click
  "Download Snapshot". PASS: JSON file downloads
  with all manually-entered data. Click "Create
  Pristine Environment", confirm. PASS: all data
  wiped. Click "Upload Snapshot", select the
  downloaded file. PASS: all data restored.
  Spot-check 3 pages to confirm data matches.

- [ ] **F12** Type in the search input (if present).
  PASS: filters flow cards by name or
  description in real-time.
- [ ] **F13** Click a flow card. PASS: navigates
  to `flows/detail.html?flowId=<id>`.

### Flow Import

- [ ] **F13b** Click "Import Flow" button on the flows list page. PASS: import dialog opens with a file upload input and a project selector dropdown.
- [ ] **F13c** Select a `.mmd` file via the file input and choose a project from the dropdown. Click "Import". PASS: flow is created, toast confirms import, and browser navigates to the flow designer for the imported flow.
- [ ] **F13d** Repeat with a `.zip` file exported from a previous flow. PASS: imported flow contains the same nodes, edges, and fields as the original.

### Flow Designer (`flows/detail.html?flowId=...`)

- [ ] **F14** Navigate to a flow designer page.
  PASS: toolbar at top with Undo, Redo, Delete
  (trash icon), Auto Layout, Zoom −/Show All/+,
  Copy Mermaid, Export. Locked checkbox in
  header controls edit lock. SVG canvas
  below with dot grid background showing the flow
  graph. Changes auto-save (no explicit Save
  button).
- [ ] **F15** Nodes display correctly: start node
  has green border with its name centered in the
  card and no subtitle, standard nodes have blue
  border with field count subtitle, complete node
  has double green border with its name centered
  in the card and no subtitle.
- [ ] **F16** Edges display correctly: forward
  edges are solid blue lines with arrow markers
  and named labels. Cycle edges — those that
  close a loop because a return path from target
  back to source already exists in the graph —
  are dashed orange with a warning arrow. Sibling
  transitions between nodes that have no return
  path render as solid blue even when they share
  a level.
- [ ] **F17** Connection ports (small circles) are
  visible on middle nodes (not on start or
  complete, and not on any node when the flow is
  locked). Each port sits on the longest open
  perimeter gap of its node, not always the right
  side. Hover over a port. PASS: cursor changes
  to crosshair and a browser tooltip reads "Click
  and drag to create a new node attached here.
  Hold Shift to connect to an existing node
  instead."
- [ ] **F18** Click a node. PASS: node gets blue
  glow selection effect. Double-click the node.
  PASS: properties panel appears showing state
  name, description, form fields list, and
  outgoing transitions.
- [ ] **F19** Drag from a middle node's port into
  empty canvas past 20 pixels, without holding
  Shift. PASS: during the drag a faint bezier
  preview plus a "New State" ghost card track the
  cursor. On release, a new middle node is
  created at the drop position and
  auto-connected from the source node with a
  default edge name.
- [ ] **F19b** Drag a standard node to a new
  position. PASS: node follows the pointer and
  can be placed freely on the canvas.
- [ ] **F19c** Attempt to drag the start node. PASS:
  it does not move (the start node is
  non-draggable — clicking anywhere on it
  initiates a drag-from-start instead). The
  complete node is draggable like standard nodes.
- [ ] **F19d** Click "Auto Layout" in toolbar. PASS:
  all nodes reposition based on their rank from
  start. Start is placed top-left, complete
  bottom-right, others arranged by graph depth.
- [ ] **F20** Hold Shift and drag from a middle
  node's port over another middle node, then
  release. PASS: during the drag the preview
  re-draws from a ghosted grey straight line
  (when the cursor is over empty canvas) into a
  curved bezier with an arrowhead the moment the
  cursor enters a valid target node. On release
  over the target, a new edge is created with a
  default name. No "New State" ghost card is
  shown while Shift is held.
- [ ] **F20a** Shift-drag forward (earlier node →
  later node). PASS: the curved preview is solid
  blue while over the target. The committed edge
  matches the preview exactly.
- [ ] **F20b** Shift-drag backward (later node →
  earlier node). PASS: the curved preview is
  dashed orange with a warning arrow while over
  the target — the reachability check recognises
  that target → … → source already exists. The
  committed cycle edge matches the preview.
- [ ] **F20c** Shift-drag and release in empty
  canvas (no node under cursor). PASS: the grey
  straight-line preview disappears and nothing
  happens — no edge, no new node.
- [ ] **F20d** Begin a plain drag from a port (no
  Shift). While the mouse remains stationary,
  press and hold Shift. PASS: without any mouse
  movement the ghost "New State" card disappears
  and the preview collapses to the grey line (or
  curved bezier if the cursor is already over a
  target). Release Shift — the ghost card
  returns. Release the mouse with Shift held to
  create an edge, or without Shift to create a
  node.
- [ ] **F21** Double-click a node, edit its name in
  the properties panel. PASS: the node label
  updates on the SVG canvas immediately (changes
  auto-save after 800ms debounce).
- [ ] **F22** Double-click a node, click "+ Add
  Field". Enter field name, select type from
  dropdown, toggle required. PASS: field appears
  in the fields list with lowercase type badge
  (e.g. "text") and red asterisk (*) if required.
- [ ] **F23** Click an edge to select it (blue glow).
  Double-click to open properties panel. PASS:
  panel shows transition name, description,
  from/to state names. Edit the name. PASS: label
  updates on the canvas.
- [ ] **F24** Select a non-start/non-complete node,
  click the Delete (trash) button in toolbar.
  PASS: node and all connected edges are removed.
- [ ] **F25** Select an edge, click the Delete
  (trash) button in toolbar. PASS: edge is
  removed from the canvas.
- [ ] **F26** Click "Zoom +" and "Zoom -" in
  toolbar. PASS: canvas zooms in and out smoothly.
  Click "Show All". PASS: canvas adjusts to
  show all nodes.
- [ ] **F27** Edit a node name via the properties
  panel, wait 1 second for auto-save. Navigate
  away and return to the designer. PASS: all
  nodes, edges, fields, and positions persist.
- [ ] **F28** Navigate to
  `flows/detail.html?flowId=nonexistent`. PASS:
  page handles gracefully — shows error state,
  no unhandled JS exception.

### Flow Designer — Undo/Redo

- [ ] **F29** After adding a state, click the Undo
  toolbar button. PASS: the state and its
