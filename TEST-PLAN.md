# Fusion Angle — Test Plan

> **Encoding:** `- [ ]` = pending (not yet executed). Run outcomes are recorded as words in the Summary (PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / DEFERRED / DRIFT), not by flipping the checkbox. Optional inline annotation: `- [FAIL]` with a note for a failed case.

### How to invoke

When the user says "run the test plan", the master
session:

1. Reads this document's `### Protocol` — required
   context. Default is the section DAG below.
2. Executes **AT** as a fail-fast gate. Any AT
   failure aborts before A1.
3. Executes A1–A5. Parallel A3 is
   `./postgres-wipe --postgres local` then
   `./postgres-seed --postgres local
   --test-plan-slices` then `node server.mjs`
   (14 disjoint slices, stdout credential
   map). Serial (`--serial`) A3 is
   `./postgres-wipe --postgres local` then
   `./postgres-seed --postgres local
   --mock-data` then `node server.mjs` (SV1).
4. Grants Chrome origin `http://localhost` **before**
   dispatch.
5. Parallel: this MCP has no isolated
   contexts — one Chrome profile, one
   cookie jar, one selected page. One
   hunter per `parallel: yes` section
   (14), each with that section's `##`
   body only and that slice's
   credentials. The master dispatches
   them **one at a time**, joining each
   before the next. Each hunter begins
   by deleting site data for the origin
   so the shared jar carries no previous
   hunter's refresh cookie. The CLI belt
   is the parallel layer. Serial: one
   tenant, document order, headers not
   consulted.
6. Joins in document order. Then K8 (process lock),
   then J. Then the canonical `## Summary Format` plus
   one mitigation-spec path per FAIL cluster. The
   master does not patch FAILs and does not
   re-dispatch.

This document is the complete regression contract — no
other coordination state is read or written.

BLOCKED ≠ FAIL. BLOCKED is reserved for known MCP
environmental limits (pointer-capture gestures,
`resize_window`, file I/O, sandbox EPERM) — never used
to mask a real failure.

### Sub-agent invocation contract

Every hunter the master dispatches MUST begin its
turn by invoking the `church-of-code:church-of-code`
skill and reading `CHURCH-OF-CODE-medium-context.md`
in full. Subagents inherit no scripture and read no
AGENTS.md by default (see AGENTS.md § Subagents).
The first line of every hunter prompt is
`Go to Medium Church!`.

After the scripture, the hunter reads
`/Users/tmornini/code/fusion-angle/AGENTS.md` in
full, then **only** its assigned `##` section body
(G includes V1–V9; F2 includes WB* and AA-WB-SETUP;
K omits K8). It does not read other sections. It
does not re-seed.

Delete site data for the origin, then sign
in as that slice's admin from the credential
map. Tab-scoped MCP tools only (navigate,
find, evaluate, snapshot, form fill).
Coordinate clicks and screenshots are
display-global and collide.

Return per-case PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / DEFERRED /
DRIFT. "Sign in as demo@…" means this hunter's
admin. Stark / Wayne names mean this hunter's
seeded org names from the map.

K runs K1–K6, then K9–K30, then K7 last. K8 is not
in this hunter.

The master does not drive the product UI after
preflight.

Hunter prompt:

```
Go to Medium Church!

Then read AGENTS.md at
/Users/tmornini/code/fusion-angle/AGENTS.md
in full.

You are the {SECTION} hunter for the
Fusion Angle TEST-PLAN parallel run.

Origin: http://localhost:{PORT}
Admin: {admin_username} / {admin_password}
Org id: {org_id}
{extra credential-map fields}

Read TEST-PLAN.md from the `{SECTION}`
`##` heading through the next `##`
heading. That body is your entire
case list. Do not read other
sections. Do not re-seed. Do not
patch FAILs.

Delete site data for the origin
before sign-in. Sign in as the
admin above. Run the cases in
document order. For K: skip K8;
run K7 last after K30.

Return one line per case:
ID PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED|DEFERRED|DRIFT
— one-line note.
```

### Scope

UI behavior: DOM, CSS, gestures, visual
rendering. Pure transitions, adapters, and
HTTP routing live in `./test` / `./validate`.
Section **SV** is the default origin (A3
**is** SV1): two cookie jars, two identities,
one Postgres. Leftover `≥ N` in a case body
is doc debt, not protocol. Where a case is
the browser counterpart of an automated area
it carries an inline pointer at the test
file.

### Protocol

The automated layer (`## AT`) runs first as a fail-fast
gate. Abort on red. On green, the browser regression
runs against **one Node origin** in one of two modes.

Parse each `##` section's four fields (`tenant`,
`parallel`, `global_lock`, `depends`). Nested letter
prefixes (V inside G, WB* and AA-WB-SETUP inside F2)
ride the parent hunter. K8 is a process-lock case, not
a K-hunter case on the parallel path.

- **Serial (`--serial`)**: A1 `./build` → ZIP; A2 unzip
  or `./build --no-zip`; A3 `./postgres-wipe
  --postgres local` then `./postgres-seed
  --postgres local --mock-data` then
  `node server.mjs` (this pin **is** SV1). One
  process, one mock tenant, one cookie jar. Walk
  document order including K8 inside K, then J.
  Headers are not consulted. Serial does not
  mint garden rows (AA and E7) and does not
  wipe to `--bootstrap`.
- **Parallel (default)**: the same A1–A2. Grant Chrome
  origin `http://localhost` before anything else. A3
  `./postgres-wipe --postgres local` then
  `./postgres-seed --postgres local
  --test-plan-slices` then `node server.mjs`.
  Capture the stdout credential map. Spawn one
  hunter per `parallel: yes` section, join that
  hunter, then spawn the next — never two
  hunters at once. This MCP has no isolated
  contexts (one Chrome profile, one cookie
  jar, one selected page). Each hunter
  deletes site data for the origin first.
  The CLI belt is the parallel layer.
  Then K8 (wipe/reseed of the shared DB; no
  hunter still running). Then J. Then summary
  + mitigation paths.

DAG edges only:

- `AT` → `A`
- `A` → every `parallel: yes` section
- those → `global_lock: process` (K8, then J)

No UI rebuild. Hunters do not create tenants
and do not re-seed. Sign-out, org-switch, theme,
sidebar, command palette, and SV two-jar stay inside
the hunter's tenant and jar. Assertions inside a job
are exact. Leftover `≥ N` in a case body is doc debt,
not protocol.

Failure:

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| AT red | Abort. No seed, no hunters. |
| A3 seed fail | Abort. No hunters. |
| Hunter crash | That section FAIL (MCP BLOCKED as today). Siblings finish. |
| Hunter FAIL cases | Join continues. Then one mitigation spec per cluster. |
| K8 fail | Record FAIL; still attempt J; still write earlier mitigations. |
| J1 sandbox EPERM | J1 BLOCKED, J2 DEFERRED. |

Master never re-dispatches a hunter to retry.

#### Known MCP limitations

- **Flow designer gestures** (port drag, shift-drag to connect,
  marquee select): synthetic PointerEvents do not reliably
  drive the `flow-interactions.ts` state machines because they
  use pointer-capture semantics. Affected tests include
  AA27–AA34, F15, F19–F23. Work around the gesture cases by
  validating end-state via message-plane fixtures (PUT a
  flow document message pair through the gate, or GET the
  flow document / its pair history for the flow's
  `uri_prefix`/`uri_id`), then reloading and verifying
  render. When the fixture succeeds and the SVG renders
  the expected end state, the case is **PASS** with the
  note `verified via pair fixture` — NOT BLOCKED.
  WB5a graph repair is pair fixture + reload.
  `BLOCKED` is reserved for cases where neither gesture
  nor fixture produces a verifiable end state.
- **List-row drag-reorders** (E11 projects, D36/D37
  ideas) share `drag-reorder.ts` (native HTML5 DnD
  on `.drag-handle`, not pointer-capture) but are
  not `computer`-driveable — CDP mouse events
  never start a native drag session. Drive them
  synthetically: `pointerdown` on `.drag-handle`,
  a real `DataTransfer`, two or more `dragover`
  samples for D37, then `drop` and `dragend`.
  Verify persistence by reload. Window at or
  above 768 CSS px; filter All.
- **Hunter probe discipline.** Visibility via
  `checkVisibility()` or `getClientRects()`, never
  a descendant's computed `display`. Never
  hand-`fetch` the API from `javascript_tool` —
  the bearer is memory-only; read the network
  log. WB16 reads the work-order history from
  the network log, never a hand `fetch`. Toasts
  via one `javascript_tool` call on
  the Members invite dialog's synchronous
  "Email is required" toast, clicking
  `.toast-close` after the 300 ms entrance and
  asserting detachment inside 3 s.
- **`resize_window`** does not change the CSS viewport;
  responsive tests at specific widths (I10) cannot be driven.
  Inspect `layout.css` manually to verify the mobile-breakpoint
  media queries (the show/hide of the desktop sidebar/header).
- **Loading skeletons** (I21): `navigate` resolves after
  the page's fetches settle, so the skeleton paints and
  clears before any probe can see it. Verify by source
  (`web-app/app/loading-states.ts`); BLOCKED is
  sanctioned.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`** cannot be emulated via the MCP;
  the behavioral tier of the reduced-motion view-transition
  test (I30) cannot be driven. Verify by source instead:
  confirm the `::view-transition-*` neutralizing rule in
  `base.css` / `responsive.css` (PASS = rule present). Observe
  true suppression manually with OS reduced-motion enabled.
- **File downloads** cannot write to disk from the MCP
  sandbox. Capture Blob content via `javascript_tool`
  intercepting `URL.createObjectURL` for validation.
- **File uploads** require constructing a `DataTransfer` in
  `javascript_tool` and dispatching a synthetic change event.
- **Keyboard events** (arrows, Cmd+K, Delete, Tab) work
  normally and bypass the pointer-capture limitation.
- **The canvas `<svg>` is replaced on every commit**:
  probe `svg.flow-canvas` by fresh query after every
  click, never through a held element reference.
- **Chords carry the browser's `key`**: Shift
  uppercases (Cmd+Shift+Z arrives as `key: 'Z'`);
  match chords Shift-insensitively.
- **On canvas nodes and edges, `el.focus()` selects
  like Tab** (the `focusin` promotion) while
  `el.click()` fires no `pointerdown` and selects
  nothing — drive canvas selection with real pointer
  events or `.focus()`.
- **`kill` syscall against the background HTTP server**: the
  Claude Code sandbox rejects `kill -TERM` and `kill -9`
  against PIDs of long-running background tasks started via
  the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true` (EPERM).
  Teardown's **J1** ("Stop `server.mjs`") cannot terminate
  the process from within the sandbox; mark J1 BLOCKED with
  the reason "sandbox EPERM on kill". The server is cleaned
  up at session end. Workaround: the user terminates manually
  after the run via
  `lsof -ti tcp:$HTTP_SERVER_PORT | xargs kill -9`
  outside the sandbox.
- **Phase 5 build-dir cleanup (J2)**: deferred while the
  server remains alive. Deleting the A2 temp dir while
  `server.mjs` holds open file descriptors leaves the
  process in an unrecoverable state. After the user kills
  the server outside the sandbox, they should `rm -rf`
  that dir. J2 is marked DEFERRED whenever J1 is BLOCKED.
- **Chrome MCP tab-group volatility**: the MCP tab group can
  dissolve between calls when no tabs in the group are
  actively held. If `tabs_create_mcp` returns "No tab
  available", recover via
  `tabs_context_mcp({ createIfEmpty: true })` to allocate a
  fresh group, then proceed. Pre-existing tab IDs from
  before the dissolution are invalidated.
- **`javascript_tool` async/await blocked by CSP**: the app
  ships `script-src 'self'` with no `unsafe-eval`, so the
  tool's async/IIFE wrapper throws `await is not defined`.
  Drive the page with callback-built `Promise`s (no `await`
  keyword).
- **`getBoundingClientRect` ≠ click coordinates**: a ~1.19×
  CSS-px ↔ screenshot-px scale exists on the driven tab.
  Click by the coordinates seen in a screenshot, never by
  `getBoundingClientRect` (its larger CSS-px values miss).
- **List pages populate slowly (5–14s)**: org-scoped list
  reads re-derive each entity's lifecycle from the
  message-plane pair ledger (`message_pairs`), so
  cards can take 5–14s to paint (Flows is slowest). Wait
  ≥14s and assert the container's `childCount` /
  `data-*-card` count — never an early screenshot, which
  shows a skeleton or blank mid-render and reads as a
  false "empty list".
- **First post-reload mouse click often only focuses**: a
  page's `init()` wires button handlers asynchronously, so a
  click landing before init merely focuses the control with
  no dialog. Use the element's `.click()` or re-click once
  init has settled.

#### Serial single-tester mode

Document order on one mock tenant. A3 **is** SV1.
SV6–SV10 run before J as today.

### Execution Order

**AT precedes everything.** Any AT failure aborts
before A1.

**Parallel (default):** A1–A2 → grant
`http://localhost` → A3 `./postgres-wipe
--postgres local` then `./postgres-seed
--postgres local --test-plan-slices` then
`node server.mjs` → 14 hunters → join in
document order → K8 → J → summary.

**Serial (`--serial`):** A1–A2 → A3
`./postgres-wipe --postgres local` then
`./postgres-seed --postgres local --mock-data`
then `node server.mjs` → A → AA → B → C → D →
E → F → F2 → FS → G → H → I → K (including K8
in document order) → R → SV6–SV10 → J.

K's product cases on the parallel path run K1–K6,
K9–K30, K7 last. K8 is skipped by the K hunter and
run by the master after join.

| **Total** | **401** |

### Combined Totals (CLI + Browser)

The per-section table above counts browser-regression
cases only (401). The CLI count is the most recent
`./validate` (AT2) report — the main `tests/*.test.ts`
suite plus the `tests/tz/*.test.ts` timezone suite; AT2
without `POSTGRES_URL` skips the seven `pg-*.test.ts` /
`schema-lifecycle.test.ts` stubs, and after AT4 those
seven run. The number grows as tests land in either
glob and is not pinned here. Update the browser count
when a case is added or removed.

Outcome categories used by run summaries (see `## Summary
Format` at the bottom of this file):

| Status   | Meaning                              | Fails? |
|----------|--------------------------------------|:------:|
| PASS     | Assertion satisfied                  |   no   |
| FAIL     | Real regression; investigate         |  YES   |
| BLOCKED  | Known MCP environmental limit        |   no   |
| DEFERRED | Skipped — dependency BLOCKED         |   no   |
| DRIFT    | Passes but doc/UI mismatch surfaced  |   no   |
| pending  | Default (`- [ ]`); not yet executed  |  n/a   |

A fully green run reports:
`PASS = AT2 + 401, FAIL = 0, BLOCKED ≤ k, DEFERRED ≤ j,
DRIFT = 0`, where AT2 is the CLI count that run reported
and the six status counts sum to AT2 + 401.
`BLOCKED ≠ FAIL` and `DRIFT ≠ FAIL` — only `FAIL`
indicates a regression.

## AT. Automated Test Suite

tenant: none
parallel: no
global_lock: none
depends: —

The automated layer is the gate. Any AT failure aborts the
run before A1's build. AT1–AT3 stay the `./validate`
gate. AT4 is additional, Postgres-gated, still
before A1. The automated layer is four cases.
Abort on any AT red.

- [ ] **AT1** Run `npx tsc --noEmit -p web-app/app/tsconfig.json`. PASS: exits 0; no diagnostics emitted.
- [ ] **AT2** Run `./test` (delegates to `TZ=UTC node --test --strip-types tests/*.test.ts` for the main suite, then `TZ=Pacific/Honolulu node --test --strip-types tests/tz/*.test.ts` for the timezone suite). PASS: exits 0; the runner's final summary reports `pass N` with `fail 0` for both suites.
- [ ] **AT3** Run `./validate`. PASS: exits 0 (composes AT1+AT2 plus the 78-char awk lint over `api/`, `web-app/`, `tests/`, `shared/`, the root `.md` files except `TEST-PLAN.md`, and the root scripts `build`, `serve`, `test`, `test-postgres`, `validate`, `generate-schema-svg`, `generate-api-documentation`, `measure`, `postgres-wipe`, `postgres-lib`, and `postgres-seed`; the org-abbreviation identifier lint over `api/`, `web-app/`, `tests/`, `shared/` `*.ts|html|css` with `compose.ts` exempt — reject `org` camel/Pascal/ORG_ identifier forms in favor of `organization`; then the `generate-schema-svg --check` SCHEMA.svg-drift gate; then the `generate-api-documentation --check` API.svg/room-drift gate). Any long-line violation prints `FILE:LINE: N chars` to stderr and fails the script; any org-abbreviation hit prints `FILE:LINE:` and fails.
- [ ] **AT4** With `POSTGRES_URL` set (A3
  requires it), run `./test-postgres`. The
  suite creates and drops its own
  `fusion_test_*` schema, so it runs against
  A3's database before A1. PASS: exits 0,
  `fail 0`. `./validate` stays Postgres-free.

---

## A. Build & Setup

tenant: none
parallel: no
global_lock: none
depends: AT

- [ ] **A1** Run `./build` from a clean working directory. PASS: exits 0, prints no errors, creates `~/Desktop/fusion-angle-server-${SHA}.zip`.
- [ ] **A2** Unzip the A1 ZIP (or run `./build --no-zip /tmp/fusion-test/`). PASS: the temp dir contains `server.mjs`, `assets/app.js`, `assets/styles.css`, `assets/` (*.woff2 fonts), 18 page directories (`api-documentation`, `auth`, `billing`, `dashboard`, `design-system`, `flows`, `ideas`, `identities`, `identity-providers`, `identity-tokens`, `invitations`, `landing`, `members`, `not-found`, `organization`, `projects`, `records`, `workbox`) with 29 HTML page files (including `api-documentation/index.html`, `flows/stats.html`, `records/detail.html`, `identities/index.html`, `identities/detail.html`, `identity-providers/index.html`, `identity-tokens/index.html`, and `invitations/index.html`), plus root `index.html`. Verb/status rooms under `api-documentation/` are generated, not PAGE_REGISTRY pages — do not count them as the 29.
- [ ] **A3** With `POSTGRES_URL`,
  `JWT_HMAC_SIGNING_KEY`, and
  `HTTP_SERVER_PORT` set. Wipe, then seed
  from the checkout, then start
  `node server.mjs` from the A2 directory.
  Empty is the wipe step, not a human
  prerequisite:

  `./postgres-wipe --postgres local`

  then the mode seed below, then listen.

  - **Serial (`--serial`):**
    `./postgres-seed --postgres local
    --mock-data` then `node server.mjs`.
    PASS: process listens; seed stdout
    prints `Save your demo sign-ins —
    shown once; copy them now.` plus
    one `username<TAB>password` line
    per seeded human (including
    `demo@example.com` and
    `sarah.chen@company.com`); listen
    stdout has no passwords; seed does
    not travel over HTTP. This pin
    **is** SV1.
  - **Parallel (default):**
    `./postgres-seed --postgres local
    --test-plan-slices` then
    `node server.mjs`.
    PASS: process listens; seed stdout
    prints the same reveal header plus
    TSV `section<TAB>field<TAB>value`
    rows covering all 14 parallel
    sections (AA's admin is
    `demo@example.com`; B names
    `seat_*` and `flow_id`; F2 names
    `flow_id`; G names
    `org2_*`, `unseated_*`,
    `member_*`, `erasable_*`;
    SV names `seat_*`);
    listen stdout has no passwords;
    seed does not travel over HTTP. If
    a section cannot run from its
    minimum fixtures, A3 FAIL — do not
    dispatch hunters. This pin **is**
    SV1 on the parallel path (listen +
    stdout reveal); the SV hunter
    skips SV1.
- [ ] **A4** Open `http://localhost:$HTTP_SERVER_PORT/` in the test browser with site data deleted and no `refresh_token` cookie. PASS: unsigned root hops to `landing/index.html` (one hop from the blank root document). Does not open `auth/` and does not open `snapshots/`. Landing remains the public marketing page; it is now also the unsigned root target.
- [ ] **A5** Open DevTools Console on that load. PASS: no 501; no JSON parse crash. An anonymous `POST /api/authentication/token` refresh 401 is acceptable.

---

## AA. Data Entry Workflow

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

Parallel: AA's slice is already bootstrap-only —
do not restart the process. Sign in as the AA
admin and run AA3+ create-from-empty.
Each later step creates data that subsequent
steps depend on. Run AA3+ in order. Serial: A3
`--mock-data` stands through J. Do not wipe to
`--bootstrap`. Do not mint garden rows: no Add
Member, no Add objective, no Create Idea, no
Submit for Review, no idea Approve, no Create
Project, no New Flow (AA26 and E7). Dialog-open
cases stay. Edits of a seeded subject stay.
AA24a may approve one seeded `submitted`
project (not an idea, not a K26 `under_review`
title). Serial leftover Convert is AA21: click
Convert to open the form; do not Create
Project.

- [ ] **AA3** Verify bootstrap data exists: user "Tony Stark", organization "Stark Industries" (domain `acmecorp.com`). `OrganizationEntity` has no plan field — its quota fields are `seats`, `projects_limit`, `ideas_limit`.

### AA2. Create Members

- [ ] **AA4** Navigate to Members (sidebar). Click "+ Add
  Member". PASS: dialog opens with a Kind toggle (Human /
  AI, Human selected by default), a Human form below
  showing Name, Email, Title, Department,
  Phone, Bio, and an AI form (hidden by default) with
  Name, a Model pulldown (grouped by provider, no
  default selection), Description, and a Skill Focus
  textarea — no Auth Token field or security warning.
- [ ] **AA5** Serial: Sarah Chen is already seated
  (Title: Project Lead, Department: Operations);
  do not Create. PASS: she appears in the
  seat-derived roster. Parallel: With Human
  selected, fill all fields for "Sarah Chen"
  (Title: Project Lead, Department: Operations).
  Click Create. PASS: toast confirms creation;
  `PUT /identities/:id` plus PII and a seat at
  the active organization (`PUT
  organizations/:id/members/:identity-id`); the
  person appears in the seat-derived roster.
- [ ] **AA6** Serial: the mock garden already
  holds all 10 humans — Sarah Chen, Mike
  Thompson, Jessica Park, David Martinez, Emily
  Rodriguez, Alex Kim, Marcus Johnson, David
  Kim, Lisa Wang, James Miller. Do not Create.
  PASS: Stark Members shows the six seated
  there (Sarah Chen, Jessica Park, Emily
  Rodriguez, Marcus Johnson, Lisa Wang, plus
  Tony Stark from AA3); the other five sit on
  Wayne. Parallel: Repeat for all 10 humans:
  Sarah Chen, Mike Thompson, Jessica Park,
  David Martinez, Emily Rodriguez, Alex Kim,
  Marcus Johnson, David Kim, Lisa Wang, James
  Miller. PASS: all 10 are written as identity
  + PII + seat and appear in the seat-derived
  roster.
- [ ] **AA7** Reload the Members page. PASS:
  the roster is seat-derived. Serial: the
  seeded humans re-render with their seats.
  Parallel: the freshly Added humans re-render
  with the seeded seats.
- [ ] **AA7a** Click "+ Add Member", switch the
  Kind toggle to AI. PASS: the Human form hides
  and the AI form appears. Serial: PASS: the
  AIs group already holds Claude Opus 4.8,
  Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.5, and Grok 4.3
  (agents are global, not seated); do not
  Create. Parallel: Fill Name, pick a Model,
  fill Description and Skill Focus. PASS:
  Create is blocked until a Model is chosen;
  once chosen, click Create →
  toast confirms and the AI is written as a
  message-plane AI agent document (`PUT
  /ai-agents/:id`); it appears in the AIs
  group (agents are global, not seated).
  Repeat for 4 AIs matching mock data (Claude
  Opus 4.8, Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.5, Grok
  4.3).

### AA3. Member Detail & Organization

- [ ] **AA8** On Members, click the current user's row.
  PASS: navigates to `member-detail` for that human. Read
  mode shows avatar, name, title •
  department subtitle, Personal Information card (Name,
  Email, Phone, Title, Department, Bio),
  Working Styles card, and Strengths card.
- [ ] **AA8a** From the Members list, click any AI
  member's row. PASS: navigates to `member-detail` for
  that AI. Read mode shows the AI identity card (Name,
  Model as "{name} — {provider}", Description) and a
  Skill Focus row; there is no Auth Token row.
- [ ] **AA9** Open the current user's own detail — the
  seeded admin, who carries three strengths (Strategic
  Planning, Data Analysis, Stakeholder Management); never
  an AA5/AA6-added human, which starts with none. Click
  Edit, change Phone and Bio, toggle Data Analysis off and
  Agile Methods on (`.strength-chip` buttons with
  `data-strength`, toggled by click — not checkboxes),
  click Save. PASS: toast "Member saved" appears and the
  page returns to read mode showing the edits — no
  navigation. Read mode renders `#member-strengths
  .pill-tag-strength` spans (three, with no
  `data-strength`); `.strength-chip` is edit-only. Reload
  the page. PASS: edited Phone, Bio, and the three
  strengths persist.
- [ ] **AA9a** From an AI member detail, click Edit,
  change Description and Skill Focus, and pick a
  different Model from the pulldown (grouped by
  provider, current model pre-selected), click Save.
  PASS: toast "AI member saved" fires and the
  page returns to read mode showing the edits — no
  navigation. Reload; the edited Description, Skill Focus,
  and Model persist.
  There is no Auth Token field.
- [ ] **AA10** Navigate to Organization. Click the
  page-level Edit button (a single button at the page
  header, not per-card), change Domain (e.g.
  `acmecorp.io`), click Save. PASS: success toast
  "Organization saved" appears.
- [ ] **AA11** Navigate away, return to Organization.
  PASS: edited Domain persists with saved value, card is
  back in read mode.
- [ ] **AA-Obj** On the Organization page, locate the
  Objectives box. Serial: 4 active objectives already
  sit in that order — "Lower expenses", "Increase
  incomes", "Raise customer NPS", "Improve employee
  morale". Do not Add. PASS: all four appear in the
  active list in that order. Parallel: Click `+ Add
  objective` four times, creating in that same order.
  PASS: all four appear in the active list in the
  order created. End-state delivered to Phase 2: 4
  active objectives — required by Agent-E's K9–K23
  scoring lifecycle, which has a read-dependency on
  the Organization Objectives produced here.

### AA4. Create Ideas

- [ ] **AA12** Navigate to Ideas. Serial: open
  seeded "AI-Powered Customer Segmentation"; do
  not Create. PASS: the idea is on the list.
  Parallel: Click "Create Idea". Fill in title,
  problem, solution, and outcome for
  "AI-Powered Customer Segmentation". Click
  "Submit Idea". PASS: idea appears on ideas
  list.
- [ ] **AA13** Navigate to that idea's detail
  page (Serial: the seeded idea. Parallel: the
  idea just created). Click "Edit". Verify
  title and text fields (problem, solution,
  outcome) are editable. Click "Save". PASS:
  toast confirms save, all fields persist.
- [ ] **AA14** Serial: Stark Ideas list already
  shows the 6 Stark mock titles — AI-Powered
  Customer Segmentation, Predictive Maintenance
  System, Smart Inventory Optimization,
  AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot,
  Sustainability Dashboard for Operations,
  Real-time Inventory Tracking System. Do not
  Create. Do not claim 11 titles on one page.
  Wayne holds the other 5; do not mint; do not
  switch here. PASS: those six titles are
  present. Parallel: Repeat creation and field
  entry for all 11 ideas matching mock data
  titles. PASS: ideas list shows all 11 with
  correct titles.

### AA5. Submit Ideas for Review

- [ ] **AA15** Serial: seeded statuses already
  match; do not Submit. PASS: "AI-Powered
  Customer Segmentation" is already
  `in_review`. Parallel: Navigate to idea #1
  detail (status: active). Click "Submit for
  Review". PASS: status changes to "In Review",
  button disappears.
- [ ] **AA16** Serial: do not Submit. PASS:
  the four Stark `in_review` titles (AI-Powered
  Customer Segmentation, AI-Powered Customer
  Support Chatbot, Sustainability Dashboard
  for Operations, Real-time Inventory Tracking
  System). Do not name Wayne titles as already
  `in_review` on this page. Parallel: Submit
  ideas 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 for review
  (matching mock data statuses). PASS: each
  transitions from active to in_review.
- [ ] **AA17** Navigate to Ideas list and
  filter by "In Review" status badge. Serial:
  PASS: 4 cards on Stark. Parallel: PASS: the
  7 just submitted ideas appear.

### AA7. Approve Ideas & Convert to Projects

- [ ] **AA18** On Ideas list, filter by "In
  Review". Click an `in_review` idea (Serial:
  seeded "AI-Powered Customer Segmentation".
  Parallel: idea #1). PASS: navigates to idea
  detail with Send Back / Approve buttons in
  the header next to Edit.
- [ ] **AA19** Serial: PASS: Send Back / Approve
  are visible; do not Approve. Parallel: Click
  "Approve". PASS: idea status changes to
  approved, confirmation shown.
- [ ] **AA20** Serial: do not Approve. PASS on
  Stark: 0 `approved`, 4 `in_review`, 2
  `active`, 0 `sent_back`. The one seeded
  `approved` idea (Automated Report Generation)
  sits on Wayne. Parallel: Approve idea #4 as
  well (it was submitted for review in AA16).
  Leave others in their current status. PASS:
  statuses match the AA walk (2 approved, rest
  in_review/active).
- [ ] **AA21** Serial: leftover Convert stays
  Automated Report Generation
  (`WurwPqXxGtLhRAoCEcPzfQ`) on Wayne. Select
  Wayne Enterprises in the sidebar footer
  `.org-switcher` (G36). Convert is visible;
  click Convert. PASS: conversion form loads
  with 4 required fields (Project Name, Time
  with a "days" input suffix, Cost, Success
  Criteria) — there is no Impact field — plus
  a Scores box holding one required baseline
  slider per active objective. Do not Create
  Project. (D16 inherits this Wayne-switch.)
  Parallel: Navigate to approved idea #1.
  Click "Convert". PASS: the same form loads.
- [ ] **AA22** Serial: do not Create Project.
  PASS: Create Project is present on the form;
  do not click it. Parallel: Fill the 4 required
  fields (Project Name, Time with a "days"
  input suffix, Cost, Success Criteria) and
  drag every objective baseline slider in the
  Scores box. PASS: Create Project stays
  disabled until all required fields AND all
  baselines are set, then enables; clicking it
  navigates to project detail for the new
  project (the baselines commit atomically
  with project creation).
- [ ] **AA22a** On the Convert form before
  scoring, every baseline slider in the Scores
  box reads as pending, not zero: the slider
  is dimmed (~50% opacity) and its value shows
  an em-dash "—" in muted text (unscored is
  genuine absence — no score row is written —
  not a measured 0). Serial: PASS: one pending
  Wayne slider (Wayne demo objective), em-dash,
  Create still disabled; inspect; do not drag;
  then select Stark Industries in
  `.org-switcher` before AA23–AA24a. Parallel:
  PASS: four sliders; dragging a slider clears
  only that row's pending styling (full
  opacity, a signed value such as "+51", a
  green check by the label) while untouched
  rows stay dimmed, and Create Project stays
  disabled until all four objectives are
  scored.
- [ ] **AA23** Serial: on a seeded project
  (AI-Powered Customer Segmentation), click
  "Edit". Set a field and Save. PASS: project
  data persists. Parallel: On the newly
  converted project detail, click "Edit". Set
  fields (title, description, status, start
  date, end date, cost baseline) to match mock
  data. Save. PASS: project data persists.
  (Impact is no longer a directly-editable
  field — it is derived read-only from the
  objective baseline scores.)
- [ ] **AA24** Serial: do not Approve remaining
  ideas; do not Convert. Hunter is on Stark
  Industries after AA22a. PASS: Projects list
  is the seeded Stark list (~16). Parallel:
  Approve remaining ideas (7, 8, 9, 10) from
  Ideas list (filter by "In Review"), then
  convert all 6 approved ideas to projects.
  PASS: Projects list shows all 6 with
  correct status and progress.

### AA8. Score and Approve Projects

- [ ] **AA24a** From the Projects list, click
  into a `submitted` project. Serial: seeded
  Market Sentiment Analyzer
  (`PIfhHMLQQxTxKFDdabXbOw`), the only Stark
  `submitted` — not a K26 `under_review` title
  (Workforce Capacity Forecasting, Predictive
  Maintenance System, Employee Training
  Assistant). Parallel: project #1 (the first
  converted project, status `submitted`).
  Click Edit, change Status to `under_review`,
  Save. PASS: toast confirms. The objectives
  section's baseline sliders are now editable
  INLINE (no Score button, no modal). Serial:
  this project was seeded `submitted` with no
  baselines — move each baseline slider off
  its initial value and click Save; Approve
  enables only once every objective is scored.
  Parallel: because this project was converted
  through the UI its baselines were committed
  at convert time, so the Approve button is
  already enabled. Click Approve; confirm.
  PASS: status flips to `approved`; the action
  bar re-renders with `Archive` / `View
  history`, and the per-objective actual
  sliders become editable. Parallel: the
  project is now eligible for the New Flow
  gate in AA25. (Without approving, projects
  remain at `submitted` and the New Flow
  button stays hidden behind the `Approve to
  add flows` info badge.)

### AA9. Create Flows

- [ ] **AA25** Navigate to Projects. Click into
  an approved project's detail. Serial: an
  approved project that already has flows —
  Sales Pipeline Modernization (Lead-to-Close)
  or AI-Powered Customer Segmentation
  (Customer Onboarding and Layout Test). PASS:
  a "Flows" section is visible listing those
  flows (not "No flows yet") and a "New Flow"
  button. Parallel: project #1 detail (status:
  approved). PASS: a "Flows" section is
  visible showing "No flows yet" empty state
  and a "New Flow" button. Non-approved
  projects show an info badge "Approve to add
  flows" instead of the button, and empty
  state reads "Flow creation limited to
  approved projects only".
- [ ] **AA26** Click "New Flow". PASS: a "New
  Flow" dialog opens with a Flow Name input
  and Create/Cancel buttons. Serial: PASS:
  Cancel; do not Create. Parallel: Enter a
  name and click Create. PASS: navigates to
  the flow designer page. The SVG canvas
  shows two nodes:
  "Create" (start, top-left with green
  border) and "Archive" (end, bottom-right
  with red 3-px border) connected by no
  edges. Toolbar shows Undo, Redo, Zoom −/+,
  Copy Mermaid, Export ZIP, and Delete (trash
  icon); the header above the canvas hosts
  the Locked, Auto Layout, and Auto Fit
  switches. Changes auto-save (no explicit
  Save button).
- [ ] **AA27** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Drag the port circle on the start
  node into empty canvas past 20 pixels. PASS:
  during the drag a ghost "New State" card
  follows the cursor along with a faint bezier
  preview. On release, a new node appears at the
  drop position with a blue border,
  auto-connected from the start by an edge with
  a default name. The start node is also
  draggable by its body.
  (The node-creation + auto-edge logic — including
  the start-node-single-outgoing rule — is now
  covered by `tests/flow-operations.test.ts`
  (`performAddNodeAtPosition` + `performAddEdge`).
  This browser case remains BLOCKED for the port-
  drag gesture itself per the MCP pointer-capture
  limitation; if the gesture cannot be driven,
  validate end-state via direct JSON injection per
  the AGENTS.md workaround.)
- [ ] **AA28** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Double-click the new blue-bordered
  node. PASS: properties panel appears with a
  "State Properties" title and close button on
  the right, then a `<fieldset>` labeled "Members"
  containing two groups — HUMANS and AIs — each
  with a labeled checkbox per member (no checkbox
  ticked yet), then a Name input, a Task Instructions
  textarea, an empty Attributes list, and outgoing
  transitions. The node gets a gold glow selection
  effect on the canvas.
  (Properties panel double-click is BLOCKED per the
  MCP pointer-capture limitation; validate end-state
  via pair fixture on the flow document address
  (`message_pairs`) per the protocol workaround.)
- [ ] **AA29** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Edit the state name in the
  properties panel to "Data Capture". PASS: the
  node label updates on the canvas immediately
  (auto-saves via 800ms debounce).
- [ ] **AA30** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Double-click the edge between
  start and "Data Capture". PASS: no properties
  panel opens — the outgoing edge from Create is
  intentionally not interactive. The edge has no
  name label visible on the canvas, just a plain
  blue arrow.
- [ ] **AA31** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Drag from "Data Capture"'s port
  into empty canvas past 20 pixels to create a
  new middle node; rename it "Review" via its
  properties panel. Rename the new edge
  "submit".
  (The add-node-at-position + auto-edge logic is
  now covered by `tests/flow-operations.test.ts`.
  This browser case remains BLOCKED for the port-
  drag gesture per the MCP pointer-capture
  limitation — validate end-state via JSON
  injection per the AGENTS.md workaround.)
- [ ] **AA32** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Hold Shift and drag from "Review"
  onto "Data Capture". PASS: during the drag the
  preview redraws as a dashed-orange curved
  bezier because a forward path "Data Capture" →
  "Review" already exists, and the reachability
  check recognises the release would close a
  loop. Release to create the cycle edge; rename
  it "needs revision". Hold Shift and drag from
  "Review" onto "Archive". PASS: preview is a
  solid-blue curved bezier (no return path).
  Release to create the edge; rename it
  "approve".
  (The connection-validation rules this would
  check — no edge to a start node, none from an
  end node, no duplicate, start-node-single-
  outgoing, and the cycle-vs-forward
  classification via the reachability check — are
  now covered by `tests/flow-operations.test.ts`
  (`performAddEdge`). This browser case remains
  BLOCKED for the shift-drag gesture itself per
  the MCP pointer-capture limitation.)
- [ ] **AA33** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: In the "Data Capture" properties
  panel, open the "Attributes" fieldset. Click the
  "+ Add Attribute…" dropdown. PASS: the picker
  lists available record attributes pre-defined
  in the bound Record. Select an attribute (e.g.
  "Company Name"). PASS: the attribute appears in
  the attributes list with mode (Editable /
  Read-only) and required toggles plus a remove
  control. (The add-attribute logic is covered by
  `tests/flow-operations.test.ts`
  (`performAddAttributeRef`) — this case verifies
  the picker rendering and attribute-binding UI
  only.)
- [ ] **AA34** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Add more attributes to "Data
  Capture": select 2–3 attributes from the
  picker, each with a distinct mode (Editable /
  Read-only) and required toggle. PASS: all
  attributes appear in the list with correct
  mode (Editable / Read-only) and toggle state.
- [ ] **AA35** Serial: N/A — requires the empty
  Create+Archive graph that serial must not
  mint; do not add nodes; do not JSON-inject.
  Parallel: Wait for auto-save (800ms
  debounce). Navigate away and back. PASS: all
  nodes, edges, and attributes persist.

### AA10. Verify Dashboard

- [ ] **AA36** Navigate to Dashboard. PASS:
  gauge cards (Time, Cost, Impact) show
  aggregated values. Serial: computed from
  the seeded project data. Parallel: computed
  from the entered project data.
- [ ] **AA37** Header stats reflect data
  counts (ideas, projects, flows). PASS:
  counts are non-zero and match. Serial:
  seeded Stark counts. Parallel: the entered
  garden counts.

### AA11. Edit & Verify Cycle

- [ ] **AA38** Edit idea #1: change title. Save,
  navigate to ideas list, return to detail. PASS:
  changed title persists. Serial: seeded
  "AI-Powered Customer Segmentation". Parallel:
  idea #1 from AA12.
- [ ] **AA39** Edit project #1: change
  description. Save, navigate away, return.
  PASS: changed description persists. Serial:
  seeded AI-Powered Customer Segmentation.
  Parallel: the first converted project.
- [ ] **AA40** Edit flow: navigate to flow
  designer, rename a state (auto-saves).
  Navigate away, return. PASS: changed state
  name persists. Serial: a seeded flow (Layout
  Test or Lead-to-Close). Parallel: the AA26
  flow.
- [ ] **AA41** Edit human member: navigate to a human
  member's detail page, click Edit, change phone number,
  Save. Navigate away, return. PASS: changed phone
  persists.
- [ ] **AA42** Edit organization: click the page-level
  Edit button, change Domain in the overview card. Save,
  navigate away, return. PASS: changed Domain persists.

## B. Entry Pages

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

### Apex (`/`)

- [ ] **B0** With site data deleted and no
  `refresh_token` cookie, open `/`. PASS: lands on
  `landing/index.html` (one hop from the blank root
  document). Does not open `auth/` and does not open
  `snapshots/`.
- [ ] **B0b** After signing in, open `/` in the same
  cookie jar. PASS: lands on `dashboard/index.html`.
  Landing (`/landing/index.html`) still stays until
  a click (B1).

### Landing Page (`landing/`)

- [ ] **B1** Page renders with marketing hero content, feature sections, and call-to-action buttons, and stays. Wait ~3 seconds. PASS: still on `landing/index.html`. No hop to dashboard.
- [ ] **B2** "Start Free Trial" (hero CTA) and "Get Started" (navbar CTA) are present and navigate to `auth/index.html`. PASS: buttons exist with correct target.
- [ ] **B3** "Sign In" button is present and navigates to `auth/index.html`. PASS: button exists with correct target.

### Auth Page (`auth/`)

> Note: the demo auto-login is RETIRED. Gated pages now require a signed-in session — after seeding (`./postgres-seed --postgres local --bootstrap` / `--mock-data`), sign in with the stdout admin credentials before exercising gated pages. Cases below that "navigate to `dashboard`" assume a valid sign-in.

- [ ] **B4** Page loads in **Sign In** mode by default. PASS: title is "Welcome back", submit button reads "Sign in" with an SVG arrow icon (matching the Sign Up button's "Create account" affordance per B10).
- [ ] **B5** On desktop (≥1024px), left panel shows branded marketing stats (10K+ Active Users, 98% Satisfaction, 50+ Integrations). PASS: two-column layout visible.
- [ ] **B6** Submit with empty fields. PASS: "Email is required" error appears below email input; input gets error styling.
- [ ] **B7** Enter `notanemail` in email, leave password empty. PASS: "Please enter a valid email address" error on email.
- [ ] **B8** Enter `test@example.com`, password `123`. PASS: "Password must be at least 6 characters" error on password.
- [ ] **B9** Enter the seeded admin credentials (`demo@example.com` + the password revealed at seed time), click "Sign in". PASS: button shows spinner briefly, then navigates to `dashboard/index.html`. Auto-login is retired, so an unseeded credential is rejected with "Invalid email or password.".
- [ ] **B10** Click the "Sign up" button (positioned next to the static "Don't have an account?" label — the label is not itself the toggle; the adjacent button is). PASS: switches to Sign Up mode — title changes to "Get started", "Company name (optional)" field appears, submit reads "Create account" with an SVG arrow icon (not a literal "→" character).
- [ ] **B11** Fill valid email + password (≥6 chars) in Sign Up mode, click the "Create account" submit control (SVG arrow icon, not a literal "→"). PASS: toast "Sign-up is coming soon — sign in with a seeded account." appears, the form flips to **Sign In** mode (title "Welcome back"), and NO navigation occurs — the demo no longer mock-establishes a session (real sign-up is SP-6 — see `TODO.md`; minting a bare mock with no refresh token would bounce on reload and could admit anyone to the seeded admin's data).

### Auth Validation Edge Cases

- [ ] **B12** In Sign In mode, enter valid email, valid password, then clear email and submit. PASS: email error reappears.
- [ ] **B13** Toggle between Sign In and Sign Up modes multiple times. PASS: form resets cleanly each time, no layout glitches.
- [ ] **B14** Footer shows "By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy." PASS: text is visible.

### Auth Session & Redirect

- [ ] **B15** With no session (Sign out, or a profile with no `refresh_token` cookie), open `dashboard/index.html` directly. PASS: bounced to `auth/index.html?return=dashboard` (the Sign In page), not the dashboard.
- [ ] **B16** From the B15 bounce, sign in with the seeded admin credentials. PASS: lands on `dashboard/index.html` — the `?return=` target, not a generic default.
- [ ] **B17** With no session, open `flows/detail.html?flowId=<id>` directly. PASS: bounced to `auth` with the flow preserved in `?return=`; after signing in, lands back on that exact flow with `flowId` intact.
- [ ] **B18** After signing in on the dashboard, reload (Cmd-R). PASS: stays authenticated on the dashboard — no bounce to `auth` (boot cookie-refreshes via `POST /api/authentication/token` with `grant_type=refresh` and `credentials: 'same-origin'`).
- [ ] **B19** With no session, open each public page in turn — `landing/`, `auth/`, `not-found/`, `design-system/`. PASS: each renders normally with NO redirect to `auth`.
- [ ] **B20** After signing in, close the tab, then reopen `dashboard/index.html` in a new tab in the **same** cookie jar. PASS: still authenticated — no bounce (the HttpOnly `refresh_token` cookie is shared by the jar; boot cookie-refreshes).
- [ ] **B21** Silent refresh: after signing in, replace the in-memory access token with an expired JWT (keep the live `refresh_token` cookie), then navigate to `members/`. PASS: the page loads with no bounce and no error card — the dead access token was cookie-refreshed transparently.
- [ ] **B22** Dead refresh: clear the `refresh_token` cookie and drop the in-memory access token, then open `dashboard/`. PASS: bounced once to `auth?return=dashboard` — no retry loop, no console error storm.

### Sidebar Sign-out

- [ ] **B23** On any gated page (e.g. dashboard), click "Sign out" in the sidebar. PASS: the `refresh_token` cookie is cleared (`Set-Cookie` `Max-Age=0`), a revocation row is recorded, and the page navigates to `auth`; pressing Back to the protected page bounces again to `auth?return=`.
- [ ] **B24** Open the app in two tabs (both signed in). Click "Sign out" in tab A, then trigger a fetch in tab B (navigate within it). PASS: tab B's next request 401s against the shared revocation ledger and bounces to `auth` — eventual cross-tab convergence, no corruption.

### Zero-membership landing (org gate)

> Setup for B25–B29: these exercise the boot/login org gate that lands a ZERO-membership identity on its pending invitations (accepting one grants the first membership and unblocks every org-scoped route). The seed gives every login-capable identity a membership, so create the zero-membership state via pair fixtures (the B21 precedent): sign in as a single-org seeded member, then append a DELETE-shaped membership document message pair (and clear any default-organization pairs) for that identity through the gate or by inserting matching `message_pairs` rows — do NOT poke a retired `memberships` table. `getOrganizations` is fenced to the derived membership ledger, so the identity now reaches no org. Their login credential is untouched.

- [ ] **B25** From the zero-membership state, sign out, then sign in again with that member's credentials. PASS: lands directly on `invitations/index.html` — NOT the `?return=` target and NOT the dashboard "Something went wrong" card; no flash of the dashboard shell (the auth-page short-circuit decides before the first navigation). Sidebar renders the member chip from token claims with NO org switcher.
- [ ] **B26** From the zero-membership state while signed in, open `dashboard/index.html` (or any org-gated page) directly and reload (Cmd-R). PASS: redirected to `invitations/index.html` by the boot org gate — no dashboard error card, no retry loop (the returning-user path, not just fresh login).
- [ ] **B27** As the zero-membership identity, land on `invitations/index.html`. PASS: the page renders and STAYS — no redirect loop (the gate's self-guard exempts the invitations page); it shows pending invitations, or the "No invitations." empty state when none exist.
- [ ] **B28** Restore the deleted membership row (or repeat with an untouched seeded member), then sign in. PASS: lands on the `?return=` target / dashboard as before — the org gate does not fire for an identity that reaches an org (B16/B18 unaffected by the new gate).
- [ ] **B29** As the zero-membership identity, open `design-system/`. PASS: renders normally with NO redirect to invitations — the org gate guards auth-gated pages; public pages degrade to the unscoped sidebar (B19).

## C. Core: Dashboard

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

- [ ] **C1** Navigate to `dashboard/`. PASS: page loads with sidebar, header, and main content area.
- [ ] **C2** Sidebar shows flat navigation
  links in this order: Dashboard,
  Organization, Ideas, Projects, Records,
  Flows, Workbox, Members, Identities, Billing,
  API, Design System. PASS: all 12 links
  present, in order, and styled. Source of
  truth: `PAGE_REGISTRY` (entries with
  `inSidebarNav: true`) in
  `web-app/app/page-registry.ts`.
  (Teams, People, Roles, Crews, Company,
  Activity Feed, and Profile sidebar entries
  have been retired — the current user's
  detail is reachable via the sidebar account/
  member chip (the old header greeting that also
  linked to it has been removed); humans and AIs
  both live on the Members page.)
- [ ] **C3** Header shows search bar, company
  stats as structured tiles (org name as a
  `header-stat-label`, then per-stat value +
  Ideas / Projects / Flows labels separated by
  `header-stat-divider` dividers — the counts track
  the current working data and change as you create
  or convert, so don't assert exact numbers),
  and theme toggle. PASS: elements visible and
  styled. The old "Good {morning/afternoon/
  evening}, {name}" greeting and the top-bar org
  `<select>` have both been REMOVED; the top bar
  shows neither. (The org switcher moved to the
  sidebar footer — see G36; the pending-invitations
  bell may appear at the top bar — see V3.)
- [ ] **C4** Dashboard renders 4 surfaces in order: three
  visually-equivalent arc-gauge cards (Time and Cost are
  ratio arc-gauges — dual concentric semicircles: outer
  baseline track + inner actual fill; Impact is a bipolar
  arc — left/right split from a center apex; all three
  share the same card chrome) and, below the grid, an
  Objectives box one gauge column wide
  (`.objective-aggregates-card`,
  `calc((100% - 2 * var(--space-6)) / 3)`; full width
  only under 768px; card title "Objectives"). PASS: all 4 render
  with baseline and current values; the Time and Cost cards
  each show dual concentric ratio arcs and the Impact card
  shows a bipolar arc; the Objectives box shows one row per
  objective, each with a small bipolar arc gauge and a
  sparkline trendline.
  Serial (A3 `--mock-data`, demo admin's active
  organization Stark): surfaces carry seeded
  scores. Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`):
  4 ideas, 3 projects, 1 flow, 4 objectives;
  both approved projects score every objective.
  A `—` Impact or a `data-empty` row is a FAIL.
- [ ] **C5** Sidebar navigation links all function correctly. PASS: clicking a sidebar link navigates to the expected page.
- [ ] **C6** Scroll the page. PASS: sidebar stays fixed, main content scrolls independently.
- [ ] **C7** Check that seed data populates all 4 dashboard
  surfaces (three arc-gauge cards + Objectives box). PASS:
  no "No data" empty states on a fresh
  mock-data load against the Phase 1 baseline. NOTE: the
  mock seed now spans TWO orgs (Stark Industries + Wayne
  Enterprises; the demo admin belongs to both) and the
  dashboard is scoped to the ACTIVE org, so its header and
  gauges show that org's slice — not global totals. Counts
  are tolerant lower bounds, not equalities (the seed
  grows): for active-org Stark expect ~6 ideas, ~16
  projects, ~4 flows, 4 objectives, plus the roster (6
  humans — 5 single-org seeded members + Tony Stark, the
  both-org admin; the System member authors seed events but
  is excluded from the roster — and 4 AIs).
  Global raw mock totals are larger (~11 ideas, ~17
  projects, ~5 flows across both orgs).
  Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`): 4 ideas, 3
  projects, 1 flow, 4 objectives; both approved
  projects score every objective. A `—` Impact or
  a `data-empty` row is a FAIL.

## D. Core: Ideas Workflow

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

### Ideas List (`ideas/`)

- [ ] **D1** Navigate to `ideas/`. PASS: list shows the active org's ideas as cards (≈6 for Stark on the mock seed — the list is org-scoped, so this is a tolerant lower bound, not the global 11; note the org-scoped reads can take 5–8s to paint, so wait for the cards before asserting empty), each with a drag-handle grip, title, status badge, and (for approved ideas) a Convert button. Ideas represent the problem-and-proposed-solution shape and do not carry time/cost/impact estimates; those fields live on projects created by conversion.
- [ ] **D2** Each idea row shows a lifecycle status badge (Active, In Review, Approved, Promoted, Sent Back, or Archived); an active idea missing a required field also shows a single "Incomplete" readiness pill (warning tone) derived from required-field presence — ready ideas and non-active ideas show no pill. PASS: the status badge always renders, and the Incomplete pill appears only on active, not-ready ideas.
- [ ] **D3** Click an idea row/title. PASS: navigates to `ideas/detail.html?ideaId=<id>` (idea-detail) with the correct `ideaId` parameter.
- [ ] **D4** "New Idea" or "Create Idea" button is visible. PASS: clicking it navigates to `ideas/create.html`.

### Idea Create Form (`ideas/create.html`)

- [ ] **D5** Page loads showing a single-page form with six conversationally-labeled fields: "Give your idea a clear title" (Title), "What problem does this solve?" (Problem Statement), "Who will benefit from this?" (Target Users), "How would you solve this?" (Proposed Solution), "What outcome do you expect?" (Expected Outcome), "How would you measure success?" (Success Metrics). Parentheticals are conceptual field names (draft keys: title, problemStatement, targetUsers, proposedSolution, expectedOutcome, successMetrics), not DOM field ids; the prompt is the visible label. DOM ids for selectors: `idea-create-field-title|problem|target|solution|outcome|metrics`. PASS: all six fields visible.
- [ ] **D6** "Submit Idea" button is disabled when any required field is empty. PASS: button is visually disabled and not clickable.
- [ ] **D7** Fill in all required fields (Title,
  Problem Statement, Proposed Solution,
  Expected Outcome). PASS: "Submit Idea" button becomes enabled.
- [ ] **D8** Click "Submit Idea". PASS: navigates to `ideas/index.html`.
- [ ] **D9** Click "Cancel". PASS: navigates to `ideas/` list.

### Idea Detail (`ideas/detail.html?ideaId=<id>`)

- [ ] **D10** Navigate to `ideas/detail.html?ideaId=<id>` (a real identifier from the Ideas list). PASS: page loads with idea title, status badge, and "Submitted by [name] @ [date/time]" in the header.
- [ ] **D11** Page displays one card: Problem & Solution (Problem Statement,
  Target Users, Proposed Solution, Expected
  Outcome, Success Metrics). PASS: all fields populated. No Details or Estimates cards.
- [ ] **D12** Click "Edit" button. PASS: text fields become editable inputs/textareas, Save and Cancel buttons appear, Edit button hides.
- [ ] **D13** Modify a field (e.g. Problem Statement or Expected Outcome), click "Save". PASS: toast "Idea saved" appears, page returns to view mode with updated data.

### Idea Detail — Edit & Actions

- [ ] **D14** Click "Edit", then "Cancel". PASS: returns to view mode with original data unchanged.
- [ ] **D15** For an idea in "in_review"
  status: clicking the card navigates to
  `ideas/detail.html` with Send Back /
  Approve buttons in the header next to Edit.
- [ ] **D16** Convert is on the list card
  (`data-idea-convert`) and on detail
  (`#idea-convert-btn`). Serial: leftover
  Convert is Automated Report Generation
  (`WurwPqXxGtLhRAoCEcPzfQ`) on Wayne. Select
  Wayne Enterprises in the sidebar footer
  `.org-switcher` (G36) — it is not on the
  Stark list. PASS: both Convert controls are
  visible; one click (list or detail) navigates
  to `ideas/convert.html`. That click does
  **not** promote (D24 does). Then select Stark
  Industries in `.org-switcher` before D17–D21.
  Parallel: a slice-garden `approved` idea,
  same control, same PASS.
- [ ] **D17** Navigate to `ideas/detail.html?ideaId=999` (non-existent). PASS: page handles gracefully — shows error state, no unhandled JS exception.

### Idea Detail — Submit for Review

- [ ] **D18** Navigate to an idea with status "active". PASS: "Submit for Review" button is visible in the header area.
- [ ] **D19** Click "Submit for Review". PASS: toast "Submitted for review", navigates to the ideas list, and the idea's status badge there now reads "In Review".

### Idea Detail — Sent Back Re-Submit

- [ ] **D20** Navigate to an idea with status "sent_back" (after a reviewer sends it back). PASS: "Submit for Review" button is visible, allowing re-submission.
- [ ] **D21** Click "Edit", modify a field, click "Save". PASS: idea updates. Click "Submit for Review". PASS: navigates to the ideas list with the idea now "In Review".

### Idea Convert (`ideas/convert.html`)

- [ ] **D22** Navigate to
  `ideas/convert.html?ideaId=<id>` for a
  convertible idea. Serial: org-switch to
  Wayne Enterprises (`.org-switcher` / G36).
  Automated Report Generation
  (`WurwPqXxGtLhRAoCEcPzfQ`) — D16 verified
  this leftover. Parallel: a slice-garden
  `approved` idea. PASS: page loads with
  conversion form showing 4 required fields:
  Project Name, Time (label "Time", unit
  "days" as the input suffix; field key
  `time-days`), Cost, Success Criteria (it
  maps to the project description). There is
  no Impact field. A Scores box renders one
  required baseline slider per active
  objective. Serial: 1 Wayne slider (Wayne
  demo objective). Parallel: 4 sliders.
  Sticky sidebar shows the idea summary
  (Title, Problem Statement, Target Users,
  Proposed Solution, Expected Outcome,
  Success Metrics). Source of truth:
  `REQUIRED_FIELDS` in
  `web-app/app/presenters/idea-conversion.ts`.
- [ ] **D23** With required fields empty, "Create
  Project" is disabled and the progress bar
  shows 0/N where N = 4 + one per active
  objective. Serial: 0/5 (4 fields + 1 Wayne
  objective). Parallel: 0/8 (4 + 4). Fill
  fields and drag baseline sliders one at a
  time. PASS: the bar increments with each
  required field AND each baseline, checkmarks
  appear next to completed items, and the
  button enables only when all required fields
  AND all baselines are set. Success Criteria
  is required — filling it advances the bar.
- [ ] **D24** Fill every required field and
  baseline (the progress bar reaches its max;
  Serial: 5/5. Parallel: 8/8), click "Create
  Project". Serial: Create Project on ARG
  after D16 verified the leftover. PASS:
  navigates to project detail page for the
  newly created project. The source idea's
  lifecycle state becomes `promoted` (list
  badge label **Promoted**, not "Approved") —
  convert is a promotion, not a re-approve.
  Then select Stark Industries in
  `.org-switcher` before D25–D30.

### Idea Status Filtering (`ideas/index.html`)

- [ ] **D25** Navigate to `ideas/index.html`. PASS: status badges appear showing each status present in the data (e.g., Active, In Review, Approved).
- [ ] **D26** Click a status badge. PASS: list filters to show only ideas with that status, badge is highlighted (`aria-pressed="true"`), others are dimmed (`data-dimmed="true"`); badges carry label + icon only (no per-badge count).
- [ ] **D27** Click the same badge again. PASS: filter clears, all ideas shown, all badges at full opacity.
- [ ] **D28** Click a different badge. PASS: filter switches to the new status.

### Idea Detail — Approval Actions

- [ ] **D29** Navigate to `ideas/detail.html?ideaId=<id>` for an in_review idea (entity ids are identifiers, not sequential integers — copy a real id from the Ideas list). PASS: page loads with idea details and Send Back / Approve buttons in the header next to Edit.
- [ ] **D30** Click "Approve". PASS: success toast,
  navigates to ideas list, idea status is now
  "approved". This is a second `approved` — not
  D16's leftover Convert subject.
- [ ] **D31** Click "Send Back". PASS: confirm dialog opens. Confirm. PASS: idea status changes to "sent_back", navigates to ideas list.
- [ ] **D32** Navigate to idea detail for a non-in_review idea. PASS: no Send Back / Approve buttons are shown.
- [ ] **D32a** On an in_review idea, click "Edit". PASS: the header shows only Cancel / Save — no Send Back, Approve, Submit, or Convert. Click Cancel: the read header (Send Back / Approve / Edit) returns.

### Ideas Workflow Integration

- [ ] **D33** After creating an idea and converting it to a project, navigate back to `ideas/`. PASS: the ideas list still loads correctly with seed data.
- [ ] **D34** Navigate from ideas list → idea convert → back button. PASS: navigates to ideas list.
- [ ] **D35** Navigate to `ideas/convert.html?ideaId=999` (non-existent). PASS: page handles gracefully — shows empty/error state, no unhandled JS exception.

### Ideas List — Drag-reorder

- [ ] **D36** On `ideas/index.html`, press and hold on an idea row then
  drag it upward past another row's midpoint. PASS: during the drag a
  hysteresis indicator appears at the target drop position, the
  dragged row follows the pointer, and on release the ideas list
  reorders in place. Reload the page — new order persists.
- [ ] **D37** During a drag, hover slowly across the midpoint of a
  neighbouring row. PASS: the drop indicator line only flips to the
  new target once the pointer crosses the hysteresis threshold, not
  on the first pixel over the midpoint.

## E. Core: Projects

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

### Projects List (`projects/`)

- [ ] **E1** Navigate to `projects/`. PASS: list shows the active org's projects (≈16 for Stark on the mock seed — the list is org-scoped, so this is a tolerant lower bound, not the old fixed 6; org-scoped reads can take ~4–5s to paint, so wait for the cards before asserting empty) with title, status, and progress. Each project card shows three metrics (time, cost, impact). Em-dash ("—") substitutes for the entire metric when its **baseline (denominator) is missing**; a zero current value over a non-zero baseline renders as `0d / 213d`, `$0k / $120k`, or `0 / 85 pts` — not em-dash. Em-dash signals "no baseline to compare against," not "zero current value." When the current is missing but the baseline is present, the half-em-dash form (e.g. `— / 46 pts`) renders the absent current side only — distinct from full em-dash (both absent) and from `0d / 213d` (zero current over present baseline).
- [ ] **E2** Click a status filter badge (e.g. "Approved"). PASS: project list filters to show only projects with that status. Click the same badge again. PASS: full list returns.
- [ ] **E3** Click a project row. PASS: navigates to `projects/detail.html?projectId=<id>`.

### Project Detail (`projects/detail.html?projectId=<id>`)

- [ ] **E4** Page loads with project summary
  card (description, dates, progress bar) and
  baseline vs. current metrics. PASS: all cards
  render with data. Baseline/current metrics
  show em dash when values are zero or missing.
- [ ] **E5** Sidebar shows the Flows section
  (Team card has been retired with the team
  data model). PASS: no Team card on the
  project sidebar.
- [ ] **E6** Flows section shows linked flows with
  node/edge counts. For approved projects, a "New
  Flow" button is visible. For non-approved
  projects, an info badge "Approve to add flows"
  appears instead and empty state reads "Flow
  creation limited to approved projects only".
  PASS: correct UI for project status.
- [ ] **E7** On an approved project, click "New
  Flow" button. PASS: a "New Flow" dialog opens
  with a Flow Name input and Create/Cancel
  buttons. Serial: PASS: dialog stays; do not
  Create. Parallel: Enter a name and click
  Create. PASS: a new flow is created and
  the browser navigates to the flow designer
  page. The new flow is associated with the
  current project.

### Project Detail — Edit Mode

- [ ] **E8** Click "Edit" button on project detail. PASS: fields become editable inputs/textareas, Save and Cancel buttons appear.
- [ ] **E9** Modify a field, click "Save". PASS: project saves successfully, returns to view mode with updated data.
- [ ] **E10** Click "Edit", then "Cancel". PASS: returns to view mode with original data unchanged.
- [ ] **E10a** On a project whose state shows action-bar buttons (`submitted` → Approve / Decline / Send back, or `approved` → Archive / View history), click "Edit". PASS: those action-bar buttons are hidden; only the State select, editable fields, and Cancel / Save remain. Click Cancel: the action-bar buttons reappear.
  Observable: `#project-review-actions` /
  `#project-lifecycle-actions` carry `hidden`
  while the inner `.action-bar` keeps its own
  `display:flex`. The objectives section and
  flows sidebar stay visible in edit mode.

### Projects List — Drag-reorder

- [ ] **E11** On `projects/index.html`, press and hold on a project
  card then drag it to a new position. PASS: drop indicator appears,
  card follows the pointer, and on release the projects list
  reorders. Reload the page — new order persists.

## F. Tools

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

### Flow List (`flows/`)

- [ ] **F1** Navigate to `flows/`. PASS: page shows
  flow cards with name, project name badge, and
  state/transition counts.
- [ ] **F2** Flow-list search. RETIRED / N/A: `flows/` has
  no search input (never shipped on the list page). Do not
  assert a filter control. PASS vacuously; re-open only if
  a flow-list search UI is added later.
- [ ] **F3** Click a flow card. PASS: navigates
  to `flows/detail.html?flowId=<id>`.

### Flow Import

(Mermaid parse/serialize round-trip is covered by
`tests/mermaid.test.ts` and ZIP read/write by
`tests/zip-guards.test.ts` — the cases below verify the import
dialog, the file-upload affordance, and that the imported flow
opens and renders.)

- [ ] **F4** Click "Import Flow" button on the flows list page. PASS: import dialog opens with a project selector dropdown and a "Choose File" button (the file input is hidden and triggered by that button).
- [ ] **F5** Choose a project from the dropdown, click "Choose File", and select a `.mmd` file — selecting the file imports it directly (no separate confirm button). PASS: flow is created, toast confirms import, and browser navigates to the flow designer for the imported flow.
- [ ] **F6** Repeat with a `.zip` file exported from a previous flow. PASS: imported flow renders with nodes, edges, and attributes visible (round-trip fidelity is covered by `tests/mermaid.test.ts` + `tests/zip-guards.test.ts`). NOTE: export ZIP carries graph + positions (`flow.mmd` / `flow.json` / `sidecar.json`) only — it does **not** rebind `flow_records`. After import the designer Record control may show **(none)** until the operator rebinds a record; that is scope, not a failed import.

### Flow Designer (`flows/detail.html?flowId=...`)

- [ ] **F7** Navigate to a flow designer page.
  PASS: page wears the standard sidebar + top-bar
  layout (formerly standalone) — left sidebar with
  the global nav, top bar with search/
  organization stats/theme toggle (no greeting —
  it has been removed), and the flow
  designer occupying the remaining content area.
  Toolbar runs vertically along the left edge of
  the canvas (inside the content area, not the
  global sidebar) with Undo/Redo, Zoom −/+,
  Copy Mermaid, Export ZIP, and Delete (trash icon)
  arranged top-to-bottom. The header above the
  canvas hosts the Back button, a Stats button, and
  three header switches (Locked, Auto Layout, Auto Fit). SVG
  canvas to the right of the toolbar with dot
  grid background showing the flow graph. When
  Auto Fit is on, conflicting interactions (drag,
  pan, zoom buttons, panel pan) are gated with a
  fire-and-toast "blocked" message rather than
  being silently absorbed; the user either turns
  Auto Fit off or accepts the constraint. Changes
  auto-save (no explicit Save button).
- [ ] **F8** Nodes display correctly: start node
  has green border with its name centered in the
  card and no subtitle, standard nodes have blue
  border with attribute count subtitle, complete
  node has a red 3-px border with its name centered
  in the card and no subtitle.
- [ ] **F9** Edges display correctly: forward
  edges are solid blue lines with arrow markers
  and named labels. Cycle edges — those that
  close a loop because a return path from target
  back to source already exists in the graph —
  are dashed orange with a warning arrow. Sibling
  transitions between nodes that have no return
  path render as solid blue even when they share
  a level.
  Serial and Parallel: open the seeded "Layout
  Test: Proposal Review Cycle" (parallel F lists
  two flows — garden Customer Onboarding plus
  Layout Test). Cycle edges live on that graph.
- [ ] **F10** Connection ports (small circles) are
  visible on every middle node when the flow is
  unlocked. Create and Archive nodes show a port
  only when they have no connected edges yet —
  per `canShowPort` in `web-app/app/flow-graph.ts`,
  ports render when not locked AND (not a
  start/complete node OR that special node has no
  connections). When the flow is locked, no node
  shows a port. Each port sits on the longest open
  perimeter gap of its node, not always the right
  side. Hover over a port. PASS: cursor changes
  to crosshair and a browser tooltip reads "Click
  and drag to create a new node attached here.
  Hold Shift to connect to an existing node
  instead."
- [ ] **F11** Click a node. PASS: node gets gold
  glow selection effect. Double-click the node.
  PASS: properties panel appears with the
  "State Properties" title and close button on
  the right (regular nodes only — Create/Archive
  nodes still show their kind title), then a
  Members fieldset (HUMANS / AIs checkbox
  groups), then state name, a Task Instructions
  textarea, the attributes list, and outgoing
  transitions.
  (Properties panel double-click is BLOCKED per the
  MCP pointer-capture limitation; validate end-state
  via pair fixture on the flow document address per
  the protocol workaround.)
- [ ] **F12** Pan so a node sits near the right
  edge of the canvas, then double-click it. PASS:
  the properties panel slides out from the
  toolbar edge over ~200ms and the canvas
  re-centers so the node sits at the visual center
  of the canvas region not covered by the panel.
  (Properties panel double-click is BLOCKED per the
  MCP pointer-capture limitation; validate end-state
  via pair fixture on the flow document address per
  the protocol workaround.)
- [ ] **F13** While the panel is open, double-click
  a different node. PASS: panel content updates to
  the new selection and the canvas re-centers on
  it.
- [ ] **F14** Enable Auto Fit, then double-click a
  node. PASS: panel opens and the canvas re-fits to
  the panel-aware visible region (no toast, no
  blocking — Auto Fit handles the re-fit via
  `fitBoxToCanvas`'s `panelOffsetPx`). Turn Auto
  Fit off and double-click again. PASS: panel opens
  and the canvas pans to keep the node visible, and
  the previous viewBox is saved for restoration when
  the panel closes.
- [ ] **F15** Drag from a middle node's port into
  empty canvas past 20 pixels, without holding
  Shift. PASS: during the drag a faint bezier
  preview plus a "New State" ghost card track the
  cursor. On release, a new middle node is
  created at the drop position and
  auto-connected from the source node with a
  default edge name.
  (The node-creation + auto-edge logic is now
  covered by `tests/flow-operations.test.ts`
  (`performAddNodeAtPosition` + `performAddEdge`).
  This browser case remains BLOCKED for the port-
  drag gesture itself per the MCP pointer-capture
  limitation.)
- [ ] **F16** Drag a standard node to a new
  position. PASS: node follows the pointer and
  can be placed freely on the canvas.
- [ ] **F17** Drag the start node. PASS: it moves
  freely like any standard node (start and
  complete nodes are both draggable; with Auto
  Layout on, the drop re-lays out — Create
  returns to the head of the first column,
  Archive to the foot of the last). Clicking
  the start node's port still initiates a
  drag-from-start to create a new state.
- [ ] **F18** Toggle the Auto Layout header
  switch twice (the seed starts ON — the first
  toggle turns it off and moves nothing). PASS:
  all nodes reposition by rank from start — one
  column per rank (one row per rank when the
  graph is taller than wide), others by graph
  depth. Create heads the first column and
  Archive ends the last — never above or below
  a column-mate; the covenant is the columns,
  not the corners. Create min x, Archive max x.
  Hunter measures laid-out node positions on
  `svg.flow-canvas` (`data-node-id` plus the
  node's x/y or transform) after the second
  Auto Layout toggle, not screenshot y. A long
  chain wraps into a serpentine (Customer
  Onboarding,
  Lead-to-Close): Create leads the top row and
  Archive ends the last — bottom-left on an
  even row count.
- [ ] **F19** Hold Shift and drag from a middle
  node's port over another middle node, then
  release. PASS: during the drag the preview
  re-draws from a ghosted grey straight line
  (when the cursor is over empty canvas) into a
  curved bezier with an arrowhead the moment the
  cursor enters a valid target node. On release
  over the target, a new edge is created with a
  default name. No "New State" ghost card is
  shown while Shift is held.
  (Applies to F19–F23: the connection-validation
  rules these would check — no edge to a start
  node, none from an end node, no duplicate edge,
  start-node-single-outgoing, and the cycle-vs-
  forward classification via the reachability
  check — are now covered by
  `tests/flow-operations.test.ts` (`performAddEdge`,
  including the noop branch for a release in empty
  canvas). F19–F23 remain BLOCKED for the shift-
  drag gesture itself per the MCP pointer-capture
  limitation; the FSM preview transitions are also
  exercised by `tests/flow-fsm-reduce.test.ts`.)
- [ ] **F20** Shift-drag forward (earlier node →
  later node). PASS: the curved preview is solid
  blue while over the target. The committed edge
  matches the preview exactly.
- [ ] **F21** Shift-drag backward (later node →
  earlier node). PASS: the curved preview is
  dashed orange with a warning arrow while over
  the target — the reachability check recognises
  that target → … → source already exists. The
  committed cycle edge matches the preview.
- [ ] **F22** Shift-drag and release in empty
  canvas (no node under cursor). PASS: the grey
  straight-line preview disappears and nothing
  happens — no edge, no new node.
- [ ] **F23** Begin a plain drag from a port (no
  Shift). While the mouse remains stationary,
  press and hold Shift. PASS: without any mouse
  movement the ghost "New State" card disappears
  and the preview collapses to the grey line (or
  curved bezier if the cursor is already over a
  target). Release Shift — the ghost card
  returns. Release the mouse with Shift held to
  create an edge, or without Shift to create a
  node.
- [ ] **F24** Double-click a node, edit its name in
  the properties panel. PASS: the node label
  updates on the SVG canvas immediately (changes
  auto-save after 800ms debounce).
- [ ] **F25** Double-click a node to open the
  properties panel. In the "Attributes" fieldset,
  click the "+ Add Attribute…" dropdown. PASS:
  the picker lists available record attributes.
  Select one. PASS: the attribute appears in the
  attributes list with mode (Editable / Read-only)
  and required toggles plus a remove control.
- [ ] **F26** Click an edge to select it (gold glow).
  Double-click to open properties panel. PASS:
  panel shows transition name, from/to state names.
  Edit the name. PASS: label updates on the canvas.
- [ ] **F27** Select a non-start/non-complete node,
  click the Delete (trash) button in toolbar.
  PASS: node and all connected edges are removed.
- [ ] **F28** Select an edge, click the Delete
  (trash) button in toolbar. PASS: edge is
  removed from the canvas.
- [ ] **F29** The seed loads with Auto Fit ON:
  click Zoom in (icon-only buttons; `title` /
  `aria-label` "Zoom in" / "Zoom out") — an
  error toast "Disable Auto-Fit to change the
  view" appears and `viewBox` stands. Toggle
  Auto Fit OFF. Click Zoom in,
  then Zoom out, re-querying `svg.flow-canvas`
  after each click (every commit rebuilds the
  `<svg>`). PASS: `viewBox` width and height
  shrink then restore (zoom steps ±0.1,
  clamped 0.25–2.0). Click the empty canvas
  once — `viewBox` keeps the zoomed value.
  Toggle Auto Fit ON — the canvas re-fits to
  all nodes.
- [ ] **F30** Edit a node name via the properties
  panel, wait 1 second for auto-save. Navigate
  away and return to the designer. PASS: all
  nodes, edges, attributes, and positions persist.
- [ ] **F31** Navigate to
  `flows/detail.html?flowId=nonexistent`. PASS:
  page handles gracefully — shows error state,
  no unhandled JS exception.

### Flow Designer — Undo/Redo

(Undo is undo-as-replay (Phase 14 Task 8): the server resolves the restore
target by replaying the flow's own document-message-pair history against its
own undo operation-message-pair history (stack+pointer — a second consecutive
undo goes FURTHER back rather than oscillating; a save after an undo-undo
truncates the abandoned branch). Redo is client-only — an in-memory stack
(`web-app/app/flow-history.ts`) cleared by `recordFlowMutation()` on every
committed content edit. This cursor algorithm, redo's in-memory stack,
exhaustion as a graceful no-op, and the 412-retry-then-fresh-resolve on a save
racing an undo are covered by `tests/flow-undo-cursor.test.ts` and
`tests/flow-operations.test.ts` (`performUndo` / `performRedo`).
`flow_versions` routes were RETIRED (Phase 15 Task 7; router 404) and the
table is DELETED (Phase Final); undo walks the flow's own
document-message-pair history only. The cases below verify the toolbar
buttons, the keyboard shortcuts, the disabled states, and that the canvas
re-renders after each step.)

- [ ] **F32** After adding a state, click the Undo
  toolbar button. PASS: the state and its
  connecting edge are removed. Redo button
  becomes enabled.
- [ ] **F33** Click the Redo toolbar button. PASS:
  the state and edge reappear.
- [ ] **F34** On a non-auto-layout flow, after moving a
  node, press Cmd+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z. PASS: node returns
  to its previous position, pixel-identical (see F37b for
  the auto-layout exception to this promise).
- [ ] **F35** After deleting a state, undo. PASS:
  the state and all its connected edges are
  restored.
- [ ] **F36** Undo and Redo buttons are disabled
  when their respective stacks are empty. PASS:
  buttons show disabled state initially. (Undo
  may stay enabled at exhaustion —
  `hasUndoHistory` is `pairs > 1`
  (`api/derive-flows.ts`) — and the click is a
  graceful server no-op.)
- [ ] **F37** Perform an action, undo, then perform
  a new action; let the new action's
  `PUT /api/organizations/:id/flows/:id` land —
  a panel rename saves `SAVE_DELAY_MS` = 800 ms
  after the last keystroke; do not click the
  canvas or another node before the PUT. PASS:
  the redo stack is cleared (redo button
  disabled).
- [ ] **F37a** Open the same flow in two tabs. In tab A, edit
  a node name and let auto-save complete. In tab B (which
  still shows the pre-edit head), click Undo immediately.
  PASS: nothing looks wrong — no error toast, no stuck
  spinner, no console error surfaces to the user. Under the
  hood the stale-basis undo collides with tab A's save (HTTP
  412) and the client silently retries with a freshly
  resolved target against the new head — the 412-retry is
  invisible to the tester by design.
- [ ] **F37b** On a flow with Auto Layout ON, add a node
  (which auto-lays-out the graph), then Undo. PASS: the
  canvas restores to the pre-edit graph. Now make ANY new
  edit (e.g. rename a node). PASS: node positions may
  re-flow to the auto-layout orientation on this next edit —
  this is expected, not a regression (the server-resolved
  restore is canvas-less; auto-layout re-computes positions
  on its own next content change). Pixel-identical restores
  are only promised for non-auto-layout (manually-positioned)
  flows, per F34.

### Flow Designer — Keyboard Shortcuts

- [ ] **F38** Tab until a node shows the focus
  outline — it also takes the selection (glow,
  `aria-current="true"`), panel closed. Press
  Delete or Backspace. PASS: the focused node
  is deleted; focus lands on `<body>`.
- [ ] **F38a** Tab again: focus moves to the next
  node or edge, never the page top; selection
  follows the focus. With the panel open the
  camera pans to reveal the selection, zoom
  unchanged. Tab across a marquee-selected
  group keeps the group selected only while
  focus lands on one of its members — Tab
  order is DOM order (render order, not
  selection order), so the first tab onto a
  non-member collapses the selection to that
  node. PASS: focus and selection stay paired
  through every re-render.
- [ ] **F38b** Tab to a node, press Enter — its
  panel opens and the node keeps focus through
  the re-render; Escape closes the panel and
  focus stays on the node. A mouse click
  selects without keeping focus. PASS:
  keyboard focus survives open and close.
- [ ] **F39** With Undo enabled, press Cmd+Z /
  Ctrl+Z — it matches the Undo toolbar button.
  Without a node click in between, press
  Cmd+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z (the browser
  reports `key: 'Z'`) — it matches Redo. PASS:
  keyboard shortcuts match toolbar button
  behavior.

### Flow Designer — Additional Coverage

- [ ] **F40** Toggle the Locked switch in the designer header.
  PASS: connection ports disappear from all middle nodes, the
  Delete toolbar button becomes disabled, and opening a properties
  panel shows panel controls as read-only (inputs `disabled`, every
  checkbox in the Members fieldset also `disabled` and
  unresponsive to clicks). Auto Layout remains enabled because
  it only repositions nodes without changing structure. Visual
  confirmation: nodes render with gold strokes regardless of
  type (Create, Archive, Regular), edges render with gold
  strokes (cycles remain dashed), edge-label backgrounds gain
  gold strokes, and the dot-grid background renders unchanged
  from its unlocked appearance. Untoggle Locked: ports return,
  the Delete button re-enables, panel controls become editable, the
  Members checkboxes become interactive again, and per-type
  colors return (Create green, Archive red, Regular blue,
  Cycle amber).
- [ ] **F41** With a non-trivial flow loaded, click "Copy Mermaid"
  in the toolbar. PASS: toast confirms the clipboard copy, and the
  clipboard holds Mermaid flowchart syntax for the current graph.
  (Round-trip correctness — `generateMermaid` → `parseMermaid`
  preserving nodes, edges, and attribute references — is covered by
  `tests/mermaid.test.ts`; this case verifies the toolbar action
  and the clipboard write.)
- [ ] **F42** Click "Export ZIP" in the toolbar. PASS: a `.zip` file
  downloads. Unzip the archive — it contains `flow.mmd` (Mermaid
  source), `flow.json` (graph with node positions), `sidecar.json`,
  and a human-readable `flow.txt`. (ZIP read/write correctness is covered
  by `tests/zip-guards.test.ts`.)
- [ ] **F43** On `flows/index.html` click "Import Flow", choose a
  project, click "Choose File", and select a `.mmd` file previously
  exported from a known flow — selecting the file imports it
  directly (no separate submit/confirm button; same shape as F5).
  PASS: the imported flow opens in the designer and renders nodes,
  edges, and attributes. (Structural fidelity of the mermaid
  round-trip is covered by `tests/mermaid.test.ts`; this case
  verifies the import dialog and that the designer opens on the
  imported flow.)
- [ ] **F44** Repeat F43 with a `.zip` archive. PASS: the imported
  flow renders with node positions preserved (not auto-laid-out).
  (ZIP round-trip is covered by `tests/zip-guards.test.ts`; this
  case verifies the `.zip` import path through the dialog and the
  preserved-position rendering.)
- [ ] **F45** Rename 11 nodes one at a time; after each
  name, wait for that flow's `PUT /api/organizations/
  :id/flows/:id` in the network log (the save fires
  `SAVE_DELAY_MS` = 800 ms after the last keystroke)
  before selecting the next node. Then click Undo 11
  times in a row. PASS: every one of the 11 renames
  reverts in order — undo walks the flow's own full
  document-message-pair history (`FLOW_VERSION_CAP`
  and `flow_versions` are retired; there is no
  10-edit bound).
- [ ] **F46** Edit a flow (rename a state), let auto-save complete.
  Navigate away from the designer to `flows/index.html`. Re-open the
  same flow. Click Undo. PASS: the rename reverts — the undo history
  survived navigation because it is the flow's own message-pair
  history, persisted to the schema, not held in memory. Unlike
  before Phase 14, this persistence has no 10-edit bound (see F45).
  Graph and name are undo content; Locked, Auto
  Layout, and Auto Fit are guards that undo never
  flips and never counts. Opening a flow writes
  nothing.

### Flow Designer — Flow Tags (API-only, no UI this phase)

(No manual browser case — Step 0 (Phase 14 Task 9) elected
API-ONLY: no designer affordance lands this phase. The
automated suite (`tests/api-flow-tags.test.ts`,
`tests/api-organization-isolation.test.ts`'s "nested
flows/:id/tags" fence case) is the sole coverage: PUT/GET/
DELETE lifecycle, Response-ID pinning survives further flow
saves, marked delete, member-tier authorization, two-tag
concurrency, and the org fence. A designer "tag current" action is tracked in
`TODO.md`.)

### Space Toggle (Pan Mode)

- [ ] **F47** With the canvas focused, tap the spacebar once.
  PASS: a primary-colored outline appears around the canvas; the
  cursor becomes `grab` over canvas, nodes, and edges.
- [ ] **F48** With pan mode on, tap the spacebar a second time.
  PASS: the outline disappears and the cursor returns to its
  default state.
- [ ] **F49** With pan mode on, drag the canvas, release, then
  drag again. PASS: both drags pan the viewport — pan mode
  persists across multiple drags until toggled off.
- [ ] **F50** Hold the spacebar down for two seconds without
  releasing. PASS: pan mode toggles on exactly once; browser
  auto-repeat does not chatter the toggle.
- [ ] **F51** Begin dragging a node. While the drag is in flight,
  tap the spacebar. PASS: the drag completes unchanged; pan mode
  state is unchanged when the drag ends.
- [ ] **F52** Begin a marquee selection on empty canvas. While the
  marquee is in flight, tap the spacebar. PASS: the marquee
  continues; pan mode state is unchanged when pointer-up
  resolves.
- [ ] **F53** Shift-drag from a node port to begin a connect
  gesture. While connecting, tap the spacebar. PASS: the connect
  gesture continues; pan mode state is unchanged at pointer-up.
- [ ] **F54** With pan mode on and a pan drag in flight, tap the
  spacebar mid-drag. PASS: the pan drag continues; pan mode
  state is unchanged until the drag ends.
- [ ] **F55** Toggle Auto-Fit on. With pan mode off, tap the
  spacebar. PASS: an error toast appears ("Disable Auto-Fit to
  change the view"); pan mode stays off.
- [ ] **F56** With pan mode on, toggle Auto-Fit on, then tap the
  spacebar. PASS: pan mode turns off cleanly with no toast —
  exiting pan mode is always permitted.
- [ ] **F57** Focus a text input (e.g. node name in the panel).
  Tap the spacebar. PASS: a literal space character is inserted
  into the input; pan mode state is unchanged.
- [ ] **F57a** Tab to a node, tap Space. PASS: the
  node's panel opens (Space activates the
  focused item); pan mode stays off.

### Members Selector (Node Panel)

- [ ] **F58** Open a regular-node properties panel. PASS:
  the Members fieldset is the first body block, with a
  "Members" legend, a HUMANS group containing one
  labeled `<input type="checkbox" data-member-id="<id>">`
  per active human (alphabetized by full name), and an
  AIs group containing one checkbox per AI member
  (alphabetized by name). When the checkbox list overflows
  the panel height, the fieldset scrolls inside its own
  region.
- [ ] **F59** Tick one human checkbox. Reload the page
  and reopen the same node panel. PASS: that human
  checkbox is still ticked. Inspect the flow's head
  document message pair — the stored graph body carries
  `memberIds: [<humanId>]`. AI checkboxes are
  display-only (`data-ai-member-id`): they reflect
  stored `agentIds` and do not write. A seeded
  `agentIds` list survives this save.
- [ ] **F60** Untick the human checkbox. Reload the page
  and reopen the panel. PASS: the human is gone from
  `memberIds`. Stored `agentIds` are unchanged.
- [ ] **F61** Untick all human checkboxes so `memberIds`
  is `[]`. Reload the page. PASS: every human checkbox
  in the panel is unticked. The node now displays the
  danger badge per F73 if no humans remain.
- [ ] **F62** Lock the flow via the designer-header Locked switch.
  Open a regular-node panel. PASS: every checkbox in the
  Members fieldset is rendered with the `disabled`
  attribute; clicking does nothing.
- [ ] **F63** Open a Start-node panel. PASS: the header
  shows the "Create" title and close button — no
  Members fieldset (Create nodes never assign members).
- [ ] **F64** Open an End-node panel. PASS: the header
  shows the "Archive" title and close button — no
  Members fieldset.
- [ ] **F65** Open an edge panel. PASS: the header shows
  "Transition Properties" title and close button — no
  Members fieldset.
- [ ] **F66** MOOT (Phase Final). The `flow_versions` table is
  DELETED; there is nothing to inspect.
  Member assignment is captured only in the flow's own
  document-message-pair history (`message_pairs`). Confirm
  via pair fixtures or F67: a `memberIds` change is still
  undoable through that history.
- [ ] **F67** Tick one checkbox in the Members fieldset,
  then press Cmd+Z (Mac) / Ctrl+Z (Win/Linux). PASS: the
  checkbox unticks — `memberIds` changes are undoable
  like name changes.

### Attribute Editor (Node Panel)

- [ ] **F68** Double-click a regular node (not Create/Archive)
  to open the properties panel. In the "Attributes"
  fieldset, click the "+ Add Attribute…" dropdown. PASS:
  the picker lists available record attributes
  pre-defined on the bound record-type (loaded via
  `getRecordAttributesByRecord` from the nested
  `record-types/:id/attributes` collection on the message
  plane).
  (Regression for the captured-presenter bug in the
  attribute-picker handler: this exact click used to do
  nothing because the handler closed over a presenter
  captured at init time, which had no selection.)
- [ ] **F69** Continuing from F68, select an attribute
  from the picker (e.g. "Contact Email"). PASS: the row
  "Contact Email" appears in the list with mode (Editable /
  Read-only) and required toggles. The dropdown
  remains available so additional attributes can be
  added.
- [ ] **F70** Continuing from F69, click the remove ("×")
  control on the "Contact Email" attribute row. PASS: the row
  disappears from the attributes list.
- [ ] **F71** Lock the flow via the designer-header Locked switch.
  Double-click a regular node. Click the disabled
  "+ Add Attribute…" dropdown in the Attributes
  fieldset. PASS: nothing happens — no panel change,
  no toast, no attribute row appended (a disabled
  `<select>` does not fire `change`).
- [ ] **F72** Double-click a regular node. Tick one
  member checkbox in the Members fieldset. Click the
  "+ Add Attribute…" dropdown in the same panel. PASS:
  the dropdown remains functional and lists available
  attributes. (Regression: a `memberIds` commit
  replaces the presenter, so a click handler that
  captured a stale presenter would have acted on the
  pre-commit snapshot — this case proves the handler
  reads the current presenter at click time.)
- [ ] **F73 — Hazard severity rendering.** On a regular
  (non-start, non-complete) node, vary the member count
  and outgoing-edge count and confirm the bottom-left
  badge:
    - **0 members** → red no-entry sign (`iconNoEntry`,
      `.flow-node-danger`). Hover → tooltip
      "Members required".
    - **0 outgoing edges** (regardless of member count) →
      red no-entry sign, tooltip "Dead end (no outgoing edges)"
      when `memberIds.length > 0`.
    - **1 member AND ≥1 outgoing edge** → yellow triangle
      (`iconAlertTriangle`, `.flow-node-warning`). Hover →
      tooltip "Single member assigned (no backup)".
    - **≥2 members AND ≥1 outgoing edge** → no badge.
  Confirm the start node and the complete node never
  display a badge regardless of state.
- [ ] **F74** With the Properties panel closed,
  confirm the flow canvas fills the content area
  to the right of the global sidebar (panel-aware
  fit honors `PANEL_WIDTH_PX`). Open the panel,
  pan the canvas, then close the panel via the X.
  PASS: pan/zoom/auto-fit/panel-toggle interactions
  read the *content-area* clientWidth, not the
  full viewport — the global sidebar does not
  steal canvas space.
- [ ] **F75** Open a flow whose layout routes edges beyond the node bounding box — the seeded "Layout Test: Proposal Review Cycle" is one (its long back-edges arc above the top row and dip well below the bottom row) — with Auto Fit on. PASS: the whole graph, including the edge curves and waypoints that bow past the outermost nodes, sits inside the canvas with margin; nothing clips at any edge (the prior bug sliced the bottom routing). Then toggle Auto Fit off then on, add then delete an edge, and undo. PASS: every re-fit re-frames the full *drawn* content (curves included), never just the node rectangles — the camera measures the rendered SVG (`.flow-content` `getBBox`), not node positions.
  Serial and Parallel: open that Layout Test
  flow (do not open the garden chain).

## F2. Workbox

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

### AA13. Workbox Source Flow

- [ ] **AA-WB-SETUP** Verify the seeded Workbox-only flow named `WB Test Flow` (A3 reveal `flow_id`) is READY in Create Work Order: four nodes Create → Capture (text + select attributes) → Review (read-only) → Archive (`isArchive: true`). Open Workbox, click "+ Create Work Order", and confirm `WB Test Flow` sits in the `READY` section (clickable, `data-flow-id` = reveal `flow_id`). Do not build or rewire the graph. This flow is mutated only by Agent-F2. Agent-F2's WO creation reads from this flow, not from any Agent-F flow. Serial (A3 `--mock-data`): no `WB Test Flow` exists; the subject is Customer Onboarding (READY once its Review node names Sarah Chen and Emily Rodriguez).

### Workbox Inbox (`workbox/`)

- [ ] **WB1** Navigate to `workbox/`. PASS:
  page shows "Workbox" title, subtitle "Your
  work order inbox", Active/Archive tabs, and
  a "Create Work Order" button (plus icon +
  label; mobile short label "Create").
- [ ] **WB2** With no work orders, the Active
  tab shows an empty state with mail icon and
  "No Active Work Orders Yet" message. The mock
  seed has active work orders, so verify against
  an org with none, or by component source.
- [ ] **WB3** Click the Archive tab. PASS: tab
  switches to show archive list (Parallel: empty.
  Serial: the Archive list holds the 105 seeded
  completed work orders.).

### Workbox — Create Work Order

- [ ] **WB4** Click "+ Create Work Order". PASS:
  a dropdown opens with up to two labeled
  sections — `READY` (clickable rows, one per
  publishable flow) — Parallel: READY includes
  `WB Test Flow` as today — Serial: READY is
  exactly Customer Onboarding and Lead-to-Close
  (never a third from AA26/E7); NOT READY is
  Fusion Angle Flow (16)
  and Layout Test: Proposal Review Cycle (15), as
  `tests/mock-flow-readiness.test.ts` pins — and
  `NOT READY` (disabled rows for any flow with
  zero-member or dead-end nodes; each carries a
  red no-entry icon and a subtitle "1 node needs
  attention" or "N nodes need attention"). Hover
  a `NOT READY` row. PASS: cursor stays default
  (no `pointer`), `aria-disabled="true"` is
  present, no `data-flow-id` attribute.
- [ ] **WB4a** Click a `NOT READY` row. PASS:
  nothing happens — the dropdown stays open, no
  navigation occurs (the click handler ignores
  rows without `data-flow-id`).
- [ ] **WB5** Click `WB Test Flow` from the
  `READY` section. PASS: work order is created,
  browser navigates to the action screen at the
  first post-start state ("Capture"). Display ID
  (8-char hex) is visible in the header. Serial:
  click Customer Onboarding; the first post-start
  state is "Data Capture".
- [ ] **WB5a** Remove the outgoing `submit` edge
  via pair fixture (no port-drag). Reload Workbox
  and open Create Work Order. PASS: the subject
  sits in `NOT READY` with subtitle "1 node needs
  attention" (`verified via pair fixture`).
  Restore the same pair, reload. PASS: the
  subject returns to `READY`. Parallel: `WB Test
  Flow` / Capture. Serial: Data Capture `submit`.
- [ ] **WB5b — Server-side gate.** The server-side
  gate is covered by
  `tests/adapters-flow-publish.test.ts`
  (`validateFlowForCreation` + `getFlowsForCreation`).
  No manual browser verification needed; this case
  PASSES by virtue of the automated coverage — the
  production IIFE bundle does not expose
  `postWorkOrderCreation` on the console, so a
  DevTools-driven verification is not available
  against the deployed build.

### Workbox — Action Screen (`workbox/detail.html`)

- [ ] **WB6** The action screen shows: back button
  (icon-only), flow name, display ID, current
  state badge, and dynamically rendered attributes
  matching the current node's attribute references
  from the flow graph.
- [ ] **WB7** Attribute types render correctly: text
  inputs, selects, number inputs, date inputs,
  checkboxes, and radio buttons as appropriate for each
  attribute type in the flow definition.
- [ ] **WB8** Transition buttons appear below
  the attributes, one per outgoing edge from the
  current node, labeled with the edge name.
- [ ] **WB9** A "Release Work Order" button is
  visible,
  separate from transition buttons.
- [ ] **WB10** A collapsible History section
  shows all transitions with from/to state
  names, user name, and relative timestamp.
- [ ] **WB10a — Bind picker on an unbound WO.**
  Open an unbound work order on a flow that has
  a record-type join and at least one instance.
  PASS: header shows an Unbound badge; a "Bind
  instance" button is visible; clicking it opens
  the bind-instance dialog listing instances for
  the flow's record type (rows use
  `data-instance-pick`, never `data-attribute-id`);
  picking an instance PUTs
  `work-orders/:id/binding` (201), the dialog
  closes, and the screen re-presents with a bound
  Instance badge and pre-filled values from the
  instance head.
- [ ] **WB10b — Disabled fields + bind prompt.**
  On an unbound work order with current-node
  attribute refs. PASS: every attribute input is
  disabled/readonly with title "Bind an instance
  before editing values"; the bind button from
  WB10a is the path to enable editing.

### Workbox — Transitions

- [ ] **WB11** Fill in required attributes and click
  a transition button. PASS: transition POSTs
  `work-orders/:id/transition` (201), work order
  moves to the next state, browser navigates back
  to the inbox. The work order appears in the
  Active tab (unclaimed). Serial: bind an instance,
  fill Company Name and Contact Email, click
  `submit` → Review.
- [ ] **WB16** On this same load's network log —
  do not navigate again — assert the binding PUT,
  the transition POST (instance shape), and the
  history GET. Never `javascript_tool` `fetch`
  (bearer is memory-only). PASS: the work-order
  document message pair head carries `display_id`
  and `flow_graph` JSON; the binding PUT is at
  `work-orders/:id/binding` with
  `{instance_id, record_type_id}`; value-bearing
  transitions are `work-orders/:id/transition`
  operation message pairs whose body is the
  **instance shape** (`targetState`, `instance_id`,
  `record_type_id`, `set`/`clear` delta, `release`,
  `transitionAt` — no `fieldValues` bag) and carry
  strong If-Match against the instance etag; pure
  moves omit `set`/`clear`/`instance_id`/
  `record_type_id` and send no If-Match; a sibling
  instance revision pair advances the head when
  the transition was value-bearing. Derived WO
  history is `(at, id)` DESC (index 0 = current)
  with one non-claim event per transition
  (`entity_id` = work-order id, `state` = target
  node id, `member_id` = actor, `at` = RFC-3339
  Zulu). Live form values come from the instance
  head, not a history fold.
- [ ] **WB12** Click the work order row in the
  Active tab. PASS: work order PUTs
  `work-orders/:id/claim` (201) and the browser
  navigates to the action screen showing the new
  state's attributes.
- [ ] **WB13** Click "Release Work Order". PASS:
  a single click DELETEs
  `work-orders/:id/claim` (204), soft-releases
  the active claim, and the browser navigates to
  the inbox, where the work order reappears in the
  Active tab.
- [ ] **WB13a — Claim → unclaim → reclaim.** From
  the Active tab, click the same work order again
  (claim). PASS: action screen opens under the
  caller's claim. Click "Release Work Order"
  (unclaim via DELETE claim). PASS: back on the
  Active tab unclaimed. Click the row a third time
  (reclaim). PASS: claim succeeds again; the message
  plane carries the sequence
  `claimed` → `claim_released` → `claimed` under
  the `(at, id)` order for this work order's
  `entity_id` (inspect via
  `GET work-orders/:id/history` or the matching
  operation message pairs). No shared event-append write is involved.
- [ ] **WB19** Subject: the bound Active WO from
  WB11–WB13 (still Active; WB14 archives it).
  Skipping because "WO already archived" is FAIL.
  After transitioning a work order through at
  least two states, read the derived history
  (`GET work-orders/:id/history` or the matching pairs in
  `message_pairs`) for this work order's id. PASS:
  rows are `(at, id)` DESC (index 0 = current); each
  non-claim event has the immutable shape `{id, entity_id,
  state, member_id, at, field_values}`, with `state`
  carrying the target node's identifier. Live values live
  on the instance head; history `field_values` may be
  empty for new-shape transitions. Verify no app code
  path mutates an existing pair — the message plane is
  append-only.
- [ ] **WB19a — Two-tab 412 on the action screen.**
  Subject: the same bound Active WO from WB11–WB13;
  skipping because "WO already archived" is FAIL.
  Bind a work order to an instance. Open the action
  screen in two tabs. In tab 2, change an instance
  value via the records detail instance editor (or a
  second transition) so the head etag advances. In
  tab 1, edit a value and transition. PASS: tab 1
  receives 412, re-GETs the instance, re-presents the
  action screen with a conflict notice and a warning
  toast ("This instance changed underneath you —
  values refreshed; re-apply your edit"),
  and does **not** auto-retry the transition.
- [ ] **WB19b — Direct instance PATCH vs transition
  412 convergence.** Subject: the same bound Active
  WO from WB11–WB13; skipping because "WO already
  archived" is FAIL. With a bound WO open on the
  action screen, PATCH the same instance from the
  record detail UI (save) so the head advances; then
  attempt a value-bearing transition on the stale
  action screen. PASS: same 412 recovery shape as
  WB19a (re-present + warning toast). Conversely,
  after a successful value-bearing transition, a
  stale instance edit on record detail also 412s and
  recovers — both writers share the instance etag
  covenant.

### Workbox — Completion

- [ ] **WB14** Transition a work order to the
  completion (Archive) node (its `isArchive` is
  true). PASS:
  work order moves to the Archive tab. It no
  longer appears in Active. Serial: on Review fill
  Reviewer Notes and click `approve`.
- [ ] **WB15** Click a completed work order in
  the Archive tab. PASS: action screen shows
  read-only view with history but no attributes
  or transition buttons.

### Workbox — Data Integrity

- [ ] **WB17** Navigate away from the action
  screen and return. PASS: all data persists
  correctly across page navigation.

### Workbox — Concurrency & Integrity

- [ ] **WB18** Open the same unclaimed work order in two browser
  tabs. In tab 1, click the row to claim it. In tab 2, attempt the
  same. PASS: tab 2 either navigates to a read-only/already-claimed
  view or the claim is rejected — and the message plane carries at
  most one live `'claimed'` event for this work order's
  `entity_id` under the `(at, id)` reduction (a stale prior claim
  is superseded by a `'claim_expired'` event, never overwritten
  in place). Inspect via `message_pairs` or derived
  `GET work-orders/:id/history` (DESC; claim rows carry
  `field_values: []`).

### Workbox — All-See-All Visibility

Every authenticated user sees every active and archived
work order regardless of node assignment. There is no
per-user visibility filter.

- [ ] **WB20** As the demo user, navigate to `workbox/`.
  Active tab. PASS: every active (non-completed,
  unclaimed — any claimer hides the row, including the
  current user's own claim) work order is listed
  regardless of its current node's `memberIds` —
  including nodes assigned only to AI members and nodes
  with zero members (which carry the danger badge in the
  designer but are still visible in the inbox).
- [ ] **WB21** Switch to the Archive tab. PASS: every
  completed work order is listed regardless of which
  member(s) the final transition referenced.
- [ ] **WB22** Inspect `web-app/app/presenters/workbox-
  inbox.ts`. PASS: `buildInboxItems` takes
  `(workOrders, transitions, claims, memberMap, mode)`
  with no scope parameter. The presenter exports nothing
  related to per-user visibility — the workbox shows all
  work orders to all users by construction.

## FS. Flow Statistics (Agent-F2 read-only domain)

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

**Mock-data blast radius:** the flow-statistics work added ~38
work orders to "Customer Onboarding" and ~6 to a second flow,
plus their flow-work-order join rows and transition chains.
Workbox cases (WB1–WB22) and dashboard counts re-baseline
against the parallel-protocol's "greater-than-or-equal-N"
tolerance; expected counts in those sections are now lower
bounds, not equalities.

**MCP note:** hover/click on SVG `<g>` works with synthetic
events on this page (no pointer-capture FSM, unlike
`flows/detail`), so FS4 / FS5 / FS7 are directly drivable by
the claude-in-chrome MCP.

### Flow Statistics Page (`flows/stats.html`)

- [ ] **FS1** From `flows/index`, click a flow card's chart
  icon → lands on `flows/stats.html?flowId=<id>`. The page
  renders the heat-tinted SVG canvas, a path stepper, and a
  legend gradient bar. No left toolbar, no slide-in props
  panel, no connection ports, no marquee. The cursor over a
  node is `pointer` (clicking is allowed); no port-drag
  affordance appears.
- [ ] **FS2** From `flows/detail`, click the Stats button in
  the header → same stats page. The "Designer" / back button
  returns to `flows/detail.html?flowId=<id>` (and preserves
  `projectId` if set).
- [ ] **FS3** Node tints span the ramp on the flagship flow
  ("Customer Onboarding"): Data Capture is yellow/red (hot),
  Review is warm, Create/Archive carry the cool (or no-data)
  tint. Node faces show the em-dash on Create and Archive and
  a value like `8.5m` / `2.1d` on regular nodes.
  Serial (A3 `--mock-data`, demo admin's active
  organization Stark): the flagship mock population.
  Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`): Capture is
  hottest, Review is warm.
- [ ] **FS4** Hover a node → a read-only stat card pops near
  it with: % of flow time, avg/median/p90 durations, visits /
  distinct WOs / Here now, ~N/wk throughput, loop-back rate, clan
  size + active producers, top producer (name + % of clan avg
  + % of node's work, with "(not in current clan)" iff
  applicable). For a branch node, `next` shows the per-edge
  split. The card has NO inputs and NO Save button.
  Mouse-out → card hides. Serial: Review's card
  subtitle names the two reviewers.
- [ ] **FS5** Click a node → the card pins (stays open on
  mouse-out). Click empty canvas → unpins. Click another
  node → re-pins to it.
- [ ] **FS6 — Hazard severity rendering on the stats
  canvas.** The stats renderer reads `n.memberHazard`
  emitted by `flow-stats-aggregate.ts`. Confirm:
    - **Zero members** → red no-entry sign (`iconNoEntry`,
      `.flow-stats-node-danger`); tooltip "Members
      required".
    - **Zero outgoing edges** (non-Archive node) → red no-entry sign;
      tooltip "Dead end (no outgoing edges)".
    - **One member AND ≥1 outgoing edge** → yellow triangle
      (`iconAlertTriangle`, `.flow-stats-node-warning`);
      tooltip "Single member assigned (no backup)".
    - **≥2 members AND ≥1 outgoing edge** → no badge.
  Create and Archive never display a badge. The
  card subtitle shows the assigned members' names joined
  by ", " (or "Unassigned" if `memberIds` is empty).
- [ ] **FS7** Path stepper: `Path 1 of M · X% of N work
  orders` with prev/next controls. Clicking next advances;
  the selected path's nodes + edges get an accent stroke and
  off-path elements dim to ~30% opacity. The highlight does
  NOT pulse or animate (deliberately distinct from the
  editor's selection glow). At the last visible path, next is
  disabled (or, if there's a rest bucket, advances to
  "+N rarer paths, combined Z%" which highlights nothing).
  Serial (A3 `--mock-data`, demo admin's active
  organization Stark): the flagship mock paths.
  Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`): two or more
  paths; path one is rooted at Create; `next` is
  enabled. The no-pulse sentence stands.
- [ ] **FS8** Dark-mode toggle persists across navigation to
  the stats page; the heat tints and the card remain legible
  in both themes. The face number text contrasts adequately
  at all heat levels.
- [ ] **FS9** Data-shape regression: heat fractions sum to
  ~100% across non-special nodes on the flagship flow. WIP
  counts in the card match the WOs currently sitting in each
  node (cross-check against the Workbox). Direct navigation
  to `flows/stats.html` with no `flowId` redirects to
  `flows/index.html`.

## G. Admin Pages

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

### Organization (`organization/index.html`)

- [ ] **G9** Navigate to `organization/index.html`. PASS:
  page wears the standard sidebar + top-bar layout. Shows
  the page header "Organization" with an Edit button, then
  an Overview card holding the org identity (read-only
  Organization Name and Domain) above a four-cell stat grid
  (Active People, Projects, Ideas, Next Billing — no health
  badge), then the Objectives box, then the Usage Overview
  card with progress bars. There is no separate General
  Information card — the read-only Name/Domain live in the
  Overview card and Edit lives in the page header — and no
  longer a Security & Administration card; Members and
  Billing are reached from the sidebar. (Overview/usage
  values are placeholders — verify the page renders
  without error; numeric accuracy arrives when wired to
  live tables.)
- [ ] **G10** In the page header, click Edit.
  PASS: page header swaps Edit for Save/Cancel; the
  Overview card's identity region switches the read-only
  Name/Domain to two inputs prefilled with the current
  Organization Name and Domain.
  (There is no health score — the retired 92/"excellent"
  badge has been removed.)
- [ ] **V8 — Organization "Sent invitations" section + Revoke
  (admin)** As an org admin with ≥1 outstanding invitation
  granted (V1), on `organization/index.html` confirm a "Sent
  invitations" section (`#sent-invitations-box`, h2 "Sent
  invitations") appears below the cards, listing one row per
  PENDING org invitation (`#sent-invitations-list`) — each row
  shows the invitee EMAIL, an "Invited {date}" sub-line, a
  state badge, and a Revoke button. PASS: the section is
  VISIBLE only when the admin read succeeds (it boots hidden
  and reveals on success). Click Revoke on a row. PASS: an
  "Invitation revoked" toast fires and the row leaves the
  pending list (a 'revoked' event supersedes the pending; the
  invitation row persists as audit, and the invitee's pending
  list — V3/V4 — no longer shows it). With no outstanding
  invitations, the list shows "No outstanding invitations."
  Revoke is idempotent (re-revoke → 204). Source:
  `web-app/organization/index.ts` (`renderSentInvitations` /
  `onSentInvitationClick`), `SentInvitationsPresenter`,
  `revokeInvitation`.
- [ ] **V9 — Sent-invitations section is admin-only** Sign in
  as a NON-admin member and open `organization/index.html`.
  PASS: the admin Sent-invitations read fails (403 "forbidden:
  listing sent invitations requires an admin role") and the
  section stays HIDDEN — the read rejects before the reveal
  line, so the box never un-hides, and no Revoke affordance is
  offered to a non-admin. (Pairs with V7's grant/revoke 403s.)
  Source: `sentInvitations` admin guard in
  `api/invitations-domain.ts`.

### Members list (`members/index.html`)

> **Session role.** G11–G14 and V* Invite cases run as
> an **org admin** (Tony Stark after mock seed). The
> Members list fills names via `fillHumanMemberPii` —
> nested `GET identities/:id/pii` (self or admin). A
> non-admin Ideas list must paint without
> `GET /identities` or `GET /identity-pii`
> (`getMemberMap` is seats + `/ai-agents`; a missing
> name may read `MEMBER_WITHOUT_PII_NAME`). Invite
> **grant** stays admin-gated in `grantInvitation`.

- [ ] **G11** Navigate to `members/index.html` (reachable
  via the "Members" sidebar entry). PASS: page header reads
  "Members" with a static subtitle "Manage humans and AIs
  in your organization" (no count display — header text is
  static, populated counts live in the sidebar header and
  the table grouping). A `+ Add Member` button
  on the right opens the kind-picker dialog. Below the
  header sit a search input and three filter chips (All /
  Humans / AIs, with All pressed by default). The list
  table groups members under HUMANS first then AIs, each
  group showing avatar/name, title (humans) or the
  model name (AIs), and department (humans only).
- [ ] **G12** Click the sidebar member chip (lower-left:
  name/avatar in the sidebar footer). PASS: navigates to
  the current human member's `member-detail` page
  (`?memberId=<id>`). (The old header greeting that also
  linked to the profile has been removed — the sidebar
  member chip is now the only "click → profile"
  affordance. Source: `web-app/app/sidebar-member.ts`.)
- [ ] **G13** Type in the search input. PASS: filters the
  list in real-time — human members match on name, email,
  title, or department; AI members match on name or
  description (not provider/model). Click the Humans
  filter chip. PASS: only the HUMANS group is visible.
  Click AIs. PASS: only the AIs group is visible. Click
  All. PASS: both groups return.
- [ ] **G14** Click `+ Add Member`. PASS: dialog opens with
  the Kind toggle defaulting to Human, the Human form
  visible, and the AI form hidden. Switch the toggle to
  AI. PASS: the Human form hides, the AI form appears
  with a Model pulldown and a Skill Focus textarea; no
  Auth Token field or security warning. Create Human
  writes `PUT /identities/:id` plus PII and `PUT`s a
  seat at the active organization so the person appears
  in the seat-derived roster. "Invite member" (V1) still
  grants a pending invitation for an EXISTING identity.
- [ ] **G14a** With Kind=AI selected, leave the Model
  pulldown on its placeholder and click Create. PASS: a
  toast "Model is required" fires and no POST happens.
  Pick a Model, fill the other AI fields, click Create.
  PASS: toast confirms and the AI is written as a
  message-plane AI agent document (`PUT /ai-agents/:id`);
  it appears in the AIs group (agents are global, not
  seated).

### Membership invitations (V) — Members "Invite member"

> "Add Member" seats a new person at the active
> organization (AA5/G14). Invite is the path that seats
> an EXISTING identity in this org. An admin invites by
> email → a pending invitation; the invitee reads it on
> `invitations/` (reached via the top-bar bell) and Accepts
> (writes a seat in the invitation's org) or
> Declines; an admin can Revoke an outstanding one from the
> Organization page. DEFERRED: email delivery (see
> `TODO.md`).
> Sources:
> `web-app/members/index.ts` (`handleInviteSubmit`),
> `web-app/app/adapters/invitations.ts`,
> `api/invitations-domain.ts` (`grantInvitation` /
> `acceptInvitation` / `declineInvitation`
> / `revokeInvitation`), `web-app/invitations/`,
> `web-app/app/invitations-indicator.ts`.

- [ ] **V1 — Invite by email grants a pending invitation** On
  `members/index.html` as an org admin, click `+ Invite member` (`#invite-
  member-btn`, mail icon). Serial: Tony Stark on Stark
  Industries after A3 mock-data. Parallel: this hunter's
  G admin. PASS: the `invite-member` dialog
  opens with a single Email input (`#invite-email`), helper
  text "Invite an existing person to this organization", a
  Cancel and a "Send invitation" submit (`#invite-member-
  submit`). Enter the email of an EXISTING identity who is NOT
  yet a member of the inviting org. Serial: a Wayne-only
  seeded human's email. Parallel: `unseated_username`
  (`g-unseated@test-plan.example`).
  Click "Send invitation". PASS: an "Invitation sent" toast
  fires, the dialog closes, and the email field is cleared.
  The grant is idempotent — sending the same email again while
  still pending returns the same pending invitation (no
  duplicate, no error). Source: `handleInviteSubmit`,
  `postInvitationGrant`, `grantInvitation`.
- [ ] **V2 — Invite rejects empty / unknown / already-member**
  Open the Invite dialog. Submit with the Email blank → an
  "Email is required" toast and no POST. Submit an email that
  matches NO identity → an inline email-field error "No
  identity found for that email." (the adapter maps the 404 to
  a 'no-identity' outcome — no toast). Submit the email of
  someone ALREADY a member of the active org → an inline
  email-field error "Already a member of this organization."
  (the 409 maps to an 'already-member' outcome). The "Failed
  to invite: …" toast fires only on an unexpected server fault.
  In all three the dialog stays usable and no pending
  invitation is created. Source: `setInviteEmailError` in
  `web-app/members/index.ts`; `grantInvitation` guards in
  `api/invitations-domain.ts`.
- [ ] **V3 — Top-bar pending-invitations bell → invitations
  page** As an identity with ≥1 pending invitation (the V1
  invitee, signed in), confirm the top bar shows a bell
  (`#invitations-bell`) with a count badge (`#invitations-
  badge`) equal to the number of pending invitations. PASS:
  the bell is VISIBLE only when pending ≥ 1 — an identity with
  zero pending invitations shows NO bell (the host carries
  `hidden`; it is never an empty bell). Click the bell. PASS:
  navigates to `invitations/index.html`. The read is identity-
  scoped (the invitation facade fences by the verified caller),
  so the bell works even for a member with no admin role.
  Source: `web-app/app/invitations-indicator.ts`
  (`mutateInvitationsBell`), `component-top-bar.html`.
  The wire path is `identities/:id/invitations/`
  (never a root `/api/invitations`).
- [ ] **V4 — Accept writes a seat; invitee becomes
  multi-org** On `invitations/index.html` (page header
  "Invitations", subtitle "Organizations inviting you to
  join"), confirm `#invitations-list` shows one card per
  PENDING invitation — org name, an "Invited by {name} ·
  {date}" sub-line, a state badge, and Accept / Decline
  buttons. Click Accept on the V1 invitation. PASS: an
  "Invitation accepted" toast fires and the row leaves the
  pending list. A REAL seat is now written in the
  INVITATION's org (the invitation's org), so the invitee becomes multi-org:
  reload any sidebar-layout page and the sidebar footer now
  shows the org `<select>` (G36) listing both their original
  org and Stark. Accept is idempotent — a re-accept is a 204
  no-op, no duplicate seat.
  Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`): the V1 invitee
  `g-unseated` holds no prior seat, so after Accept `GET
  identities/:id/organizations/` lists ONE org and the
  sidebar footer shows it as plain text with no `<select>`
  (G36 needs two); multi-org is exercised by V7's invitee
  half (G Member accepts Wayne → both listed). Serial
  stands as written. Source:
  `postInvitationAcceptance`, `acceptInvitation` (atomic
  seat document message pair + invitations/:id/acceptance
  operation message pair via `appendMessagePair`).
- [ ] **V5 — Decline appends declined, writes no seat**
  As an invitee with a fresh pending invitation, on
  `invitations/` click Decline. PASS: an "Invitation declined"
  toast fires, the row leaves the pending list, and NO
  seat is written (the declined org does NOT appear in
  the sidebar switcher and its rows stay unreachable). With no
  pending invitations remaining, the list shows the empty
  state "No invitations." and the top-bar bell disappears
  (V3). Decline is idempotent (re-decline → 204). Source:
  `postInvitationDecline`, `declineInvitation`.
- [ ] **V6 — Org fence: a pending invite is invisible until
  accepted** While the V1 invitation is still PENDING (before
  V4), confirm the org fence holds: the invitee is NOT in the
  inviting org's Members roster (the roster derives from
  seats, and no seat exists yet), and the
  inviting org is NOT reachable by the invitee — it does not
  appear in their sidebar org `<select>` and boot will not
  scope a token to it (a pending invitation grants no
  seat). Only after Accept (V4) does the seat
  appear and the org become reachable. PASS: pending ⇒ not in
  roster, not reachable; accepted ⇒ both. Source: the org
  fence (`resolveOwningOrganization` via
  `writeAuthorizerFor`), `acceptInvitation`.
- [ ] **V7 — Authz: non-admin grant/revoke rejected; invitee
  may still read & accept** Sign in as a NON-admin member of
  an org (a seeded human with no admin role). PASS: any
  attempt to grant — POST `invitations` (the path behind the
  Invite dialog) — is rejected with "forbidden: POST
  /organizations/<orgId>/invitations/ requires a role this
  principal lacks" (403), and the
  Organization page's Sent-invitations admin read fails and
  the section stays hidden (V9), so no Revoke is offered; a
  forced revoke — PUT
  `/organizations/<orgId>/invitations/<invitationId>`
  with `{state: "revoked"}` — is rejected with
  "forbidden: PUT /organizations/<orgId>/invitations/
  <invitationId> requires a role this principal lacks"
  (403). YET the SAME role-
  less identity, when it is the INVITEE, CAN read its own
  invitations (the bell + `invitations/` work — the read is
  identity-scoped, not admin-gated) and CAN Accept/Decline its
  own invitation (V4/V5). PASS: grant/revoke require admin;
  read/accept/decline require only being the invitee. Source:
  the absent `MEMBER_VERBS` row for the org invitation nest
  (`api/authorization.ts`) and `authorizeRequest`
  (`api/request-auth.ts`), which 403s before any handler;
  the invitee read/accept/decline paths ride the identity
  nest.
  Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`): run before G46
  so `G Member` still has PII and can sign in; the
  invitee half is granted from the second G
  organization (`org2_*`). Serial (A3 `--mock-data`,
  demo admin's active organization Stark): any
  seeded non-admin human.

### Member detail — Human (`members/detail.html?memberId=<hw_*>`)

- [ ] **G19** From `members/index.html`, click any human
  member's row. PASS: navigates to `member-detail`. Read
  mode shows avatar (initials), name,
  title • department subtitle, Personal Information card
  (Name, Email, Phone, Title, Department,
  Bio), Working Styles card (4-axis dimensions surfaced
  under presentation labels Mover / Shaker / Prover /
  Maker, backed by data keys `driver` / `analytical` /
  `expressive` / `amiable`), and Strengths card.
- [ ] **G20** Click Edit. PASS: header swaps Edit for
  Cancel/Save; Personal Information card switches to
  inputs (Name text, Email email-input, Phone
  text, Title text, Department select, Bio textarea);
  Strengths card switches to a tag picker. Working
  Styles card stays read-only.
- [ ] **G21** Edit Phone and Bio, toggle one strength on
  and one off, click Save. PASS: toast "Member saved"
  appears. PASS: the page returns to read mode showing
  the edits. Reload; all edits persist.
- [ ] **G22** Click Edit, change a field, press `Escape`.
  PASS: edits discarded, view returns to read mode.
- [ ] **G23** Click Edit, change a text field, press
  `Enter` while focused on the input. PASS: save fires
  (toast "Member saved") and the page returns to read
  mode.
- [ ] **G23a** From `member-detail`, click the back button.
  PASS: returns to `members/index.html`.

### Member detail — AI (`members/detail.html?memberId=<ai_*>`)

- [ ] **G24** From `members/index.html`, click any AI
  member's row. PASS: navigates to `member-detail`. Read
  mode shows the AI Member card (Name, Model as
  "{name} — {provider}", Description, Skill Focus);
  there is no Auth Token section.
- [ ] **G24a** Click Edit. PASS: identity fields become
  inputs (Name text, Model pulldown grouped by provider
  with the current model pre-selected, Description
  textarea, Skill Focus textarea); there is no Auth
  Token field.
  Change Description and Skill Focus, click Save. PASS:
  toast "AI member saved"; the page returns to read mode
  showing the edits; reload and they persist.
- [ ] **G24b** Click Edit again, pick a different Model
  from the pulldown, click Save. PASS: toast "AI member
  saved"; the page returns to read mode showing the new
  model; reload and it persists as
  "{name} — {provider}".

### Identities (list & detail) (`identities/`, `identities/detail.html`)

- [ ] **G43** Navigate to `identities/index.html` (or click "Identities" in the sidebar). PASS: the header reads "Identities" with an "Add Identity" button (`#add-identity-btn`); `#identity-list` renders one `.card[data-identity-id]` per identity — a person row shows an initials avatar + name + email sub-line + a "Person" badge; a service row shows a shield avatar plus "Service account" + "—" (agents are not identities), then a "Service" badge. Serial (A3 `--mock-data`, demo admin's active organization Stark): the nested PII fence (viaMembership, need-to-know) hides the five org-2-only persons: the list renders 6 named person rows (Emily Rodriguez, Sarah Chen, Lisa Wang, Marcus Johnson, Tony Stark, Jessica Park), 5 "Identity without PII" person rows (the org-2-only members: David Martinez, Alex Kim, Mike Thompson, David Kim, James), and 1 service row (the system service identity). Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`): `identities/` is global (`organizationNested: false`) and the seed is one DB for all 14 slices, so the hunter sees bootstrap current + the system service identity + every slice admin + the B/G/SV extras — not a five-name closed G roster. `getIdentityRoster` GETs identities only — the G extras AI agent is `ai-agents/:id`, not an identity row, so no agent appears on the list. Named G people: G admin, `G Member`, `G Unseated`, plus the system service identity; other-slice people often render as "Identity without PII" (PII 403). An empty roster renders "No identities yet." Source: `web-app/identities/index.ts`, `web-app/app/presenters/identity-list.ts` (`IdentityRosterPresenter`).
- [ ] **G44** Click "Add Identity". PASS: the `add-identity` dialog opens with a Kind toggle (Person checked by default / Service). With Person selected, the person form (`#add-identity-person-form`) shows Name/Email/Phone/Bio inputs; fill Name + Email, click "Create" (`#add-identity-submit`) → two sequential requests (POST `identities` `{id, kind}`, then PUT `identities/:id/pii` carrying the PII fields), an "Identity added" toast, the dialog closes, and the new person appears in the roster (name + email); a second-hop failure toasts a partial-state message naming the PII-less identity rather than a blanket create failure. Re-open the dialog and click the "Service" radio → the person form hides and the service form (`#svc-secret`, "Client Secret") shows; enter a secret, Create → a "Service identity added" toast, the dialog closes, and a new "Service"-badged row appears. Submitting Person with an empty Name or Email shows "Name and email are required" and keeps the dialog open. Source: `web-app/identities/index.ts` (`handleAddIdentitySubmit` / `submitPersonForm` / `submitServiceForm`).
- [ ] **G45** From the roster, click a person row (`.card[data-identity-id]`). PASS: navigates to `identities/detail.html?identityId=<id>`, which renders the back button (`#identity-back-btn`), the name + a kind badge + the id, a "Personal Information" card (Name/Email/Phone/Bio — each empty field rendered as "—" via `DISPLAY_ABSENT`), a "Connections" card (Identity Providers / Tokens buttons), and — for a person — an "Erase PII" button (`#identity-erase-btn`). A service identity instead shows a "Credentials" card and NO erase button (only persons carry erasable PII). Source: `web-app/identities/index.ts` (`onListClick`), `web-app/identities/detail.ts`, `web-app/app/presenters/identity-detail.ts`.
- [ ] **G46** On `G Erasable`'s identity detail (parallel — never the G admin and never `G Member`; serial: any person row that is not the signed-in admin), click "Erase PII" (`#identity-erase-btn`) to open the native `<dialog id="confirm-erase-dialog">` (`role="alertdialog"`, title "Erase personal information?", body "The identity itself survives; only its personal information is erased."); confirm via the `data-action="confirm-erase"` button. PASS: `deleteIdentityPii` runs, a "Personal information erased" toast appears, and the view re-renders in place — the name becomes "Identity without PII" (`IDENTITY_WITHOUT_PII_NAME`) and Email/Phone/Bio all read "—" (`DISPLAY_ABSENT`); the identity row still exists in the roster (erasure splices `identity_pii` only, leaving the identity and every `member_id` reference intact). The surviving pair at the address is the bodyless DELETE tombstone (head). Erased name remains in superseded pairs; derived reads and login show none. Cancel/Escape (`data-dialog-cancel="confirm-erase"`) leaves the PII unchanged. Source: `web-app/identities/detail.ts` (`performErase` → `deleteIdentityPii`). MCP note: drive the native `<dialog>` directly — no `window.confirm` stub needed.
- [ ] **G47** On the system service identity's detail page (admin session), a "Client registration" card renders before Credentials showing "Not registered." and a "Register client" button (`data-identity-action="registration"`). Click it → the `client-registration-dialog` opens; fill Grant types `client_credentials`, Audience `fusion-angle`, JWKS `{"keys":[]}`, leave Status Active, Save (`#client-registration-submit`) → "Client registration saved" toast, dialog closes, the card shows an `active` pill (`data-tone="success"`) plus Grant types / Redirect URIs / Audience / JWKS fields, and the button reads "Manage registration". Re-open, change JWKS, Save → the card reflects the new JWKS (rotate = same PUT-overwrite). Re-open, set Status Disabled, Save → `disabled` pill (`data-tone="warning"`). Re-open → a "Deregister" button (`#client-registration-deregister`, hidden while unregistered) is visible; click it → "Client registration removed" toast and the card returns to "Not registered." Empty Grant types / Audience / JWKS shows "Grant types, audience, and JWKS are required" and keeps the dialog open. Cancel (`data-dialog-cancel="client-registration"`) discards edits. Source: `web-app/identities/detail.ts` (`saveRegistration` / `deregisterClient`), `web-app/app/presenters/identity-detail.ts` (`buildRegistrationCard`). Wire: PUT|GET|DELETE `identities/:id/registration` (admin realm; kind gate 404/400).

### Identity tokens & providers (`identity-tokens/`, `identity-providers/`)

- [ ] **G25** Open `identities/`, click an identity, then its "Tokens" link (`data-identity-link="tokens"`). PASS: the page title is "Tokens" with muted subtitle "Refresh-token chains for this identity"; the page renders one card per chain, each showing the chain id, the event jti, `parent: —` for a root event (or the parent jti for a rotated one), an `issued`/`rotated`/`revoked` badge, and a LOCAL-time stamp; an identity with no tokens shows "No tokens." The presenter consumes the adapter's camelCase `TokenEvent` domain shape (`jti`, `parentJti`, `action`, `at`) — a snake_case storage leak would render `parent: undefined` instead of `parent: —`. A non-canonical `identityId` (any value that is not a 22-character identifier) 400s at the route gate; an absent one bounces to `identities/`. Source: `GET identities/:id/tokens` via `web-app/app/adapters/identity-tokens.ts` (`TokenEvent`), `web-app/app/presenters/identity-tokens.ts`.
- [ ] **G26** From the same detail, click its "Providers" link (`data-identity-link="providers"`). PASS: the page title is "Identity Providers" with muted subtitle "External sign-in links for this identity"; the page renders one card per link/unlink event (provider name + the `providerSubject` + a `linked`/`unlinked` badge + local-time stamp), or "No linked providers." for an identity with none (the seeded Tony Stark logs in by password, so its providers list is empty). The presenter consumes the adapter's camelCase `ProviderEvent` shape (`provider`, `providerSubject`, `action`, `at`). Source: `GET identities/:id/providers` via `web-app/app/adapters/identity-providers.ts` (`ProviderEvent`), `web-app/app/presenters/identity-providers.ts`.

### Sidebar org-switcher

- [ ] **G36 — Sidebar org-switcher (multi-org user)** A3 mock-data seeds two orgs and Tony Stark is the multi-org admin. Sign in as Tony. The SIDEBAR FOOTER (not the top bar) shows an inline native org `<select>` (`.org-switcher`, inside `#sidebar-org-switcher` / `#mobile-sidebar-org-switcher`) next to the member chip — it appears ONLY because the user can reach ≥2 orgs (`shouldShowOrganizationSwitcher`). PASS: the select lists "Stark Industries" and "Wayne Enterprises" with Stark active; the plain org-name text line in the chip is cleared so the org is not named twice. Note the Members and Ideas lists for Stark. Select "Wayne Enterprises" → the page does a FULL reload and re-scopes: Members shows Wayne's roster and Ideas shows Wayne's ideas (org-fenced — Stark's rows are no longer visible). Reload the page again WITHOUT changing the select → the selection persists (Wayne stays active; the choice is stored under `fusion-angle:active-organization-id` and boot re-exchanges a scoped token from it). A single-org seeded user, by contrast, sees NO `<select>` in the sidebar — just the org name as PLAIN TEXT in the chip. The top bar shows neither the switcher nor a greeting; its only org-aware affordance is the pending-invitations bell (V3). Source of truth: `web-app/app/organization-switcher.ts`, `web-app/app/sidebar-member.ts`, `web-app/app/adapters/organization-session.ts`, `web-app/app/core.ts::scopeBootToActiveOrganization`.
- [ ] **G41** Person and agent writes land on the message
  plane. On a human detail page, click Edit, change
  Title or Bio, and Save. PASS: `PUT /identities/:id`
  (and PII when contact fields change) persists the
  profile; reload shows the new values. On an AI
  detail page, change Description or Skill Focus and
  Save. PASS: `PUT /ai-agents/:id` persists; reload
  shows the new values. No composing POST writes
  three pairs.

### Billing (`billing/`) — STUB

Billing is a placeholder page. `init()` is empty and
the body is hand-written static HTML. These tests
verify the page loads and the sidebar nav link
works; functional billing is tracked in `TODO.md`.

- [ ] **G42** Click "Billing" in the sidebar. PASS:
  browser navigates to `billing/index.html`. The page
  renders without console errors. Sidebar highlights
  the Billing link as active. No runtime JS errors
  from the empty `init()`.

### Organization General Information — Edit Cycle

- [ ] **G38** On `organization/index.html`, click
  Edit in the page header. Modify the
  Domain to a new value. Click Cancel. PASS: card
  returns to read mode, Domain shows the original
  (unmodified) value, no toast fires.
- [ ] **G39** Click Edit again. Modify Domain.
  Press `Escape`. PASS: card returns to read mode,
  Domain shows the original value (Escape behaves
  identically to Cancel; same code path as the
  Member Detail edit cycle).
- [ ] **G40** Click Edit. Modify both Organization
  Name and Domain. Click Save. PASS: toast
  "Organization saved" fires at top-center,
  card returns to read mode showing the new
  values. Reload the page. PASS: new values
  persist (round-tripped through
  `PUT /organizations/<id>`). Inspect the
  `organizations/:id` document message pairs on the message
  plane (`message_pairs`): the latest head
  body carries the updated `name` and `domain`
  alongside the unchanged `seats`,
  `projects_limit`, `ideas_limit`, and
  `next_billing` fields (no `organizations` entity
  store remains after Phase Final).

## H. Reference & System

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

- [ ] **H1** Navigate to `design-system/`. PASS: component gallery renders showing buttons, badges, cards, form elements, toasts, and other UI components from the design system.
- [ ] **H2** Navigate to `not-found/`. PASS: 404 page renders with a message and a link back to the dashboard or landing page.

---

## I. Cross-Cutting Concerns

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

### Theme

- [ ] **I1** Click the theme toggle (sun/moon icon) in the header, select "Dark". PASS: page switches to dark theme — background darkens, text lightens, CSS custom properties update.
- [ ] **I2** Navigate to another page. PASS: dark theme persists across navigation.
- [ ] **I3** Select "Light" theme. PASS: page returns to light theme.
- [ ] **I4** Select "System" theme. PASS: theme follows OS preference (matches `prefers-color-scheme`).
- [ ] **I5** Reload the page. PASS: theme choice persists (stored in `localStorage` key `fusion-angle:theme`).
- [ ] **I6** Open the app in a second browser tab. Change theme in the first tab. PASS: second tab updates to the new theme without manual reload (cross-tab sync via StorageEvent).

### Sidebar

- [ ] **I7** Click the sidebar collapse button. PASS: sidebar collapses to icon-only view, main content area expands.
- [ ] **I8** Navigate to another page. PASS:
  collapsed state persists (stored in
  `localStorage` key
  `fusion-angle:sidebar-collapsed`).
- [ ] **I9** Click the expand button. PASS: sidebar returns to full width with labels.

### Mobile Responsive

- [ ] **I10 — Mobile breakpoint** (NOT MCP-driven — `resize_window` does not change the CSS viewport). Verify by source: read `web-app/app/styles/layout.css` and confirm the `@media (max-width: 767px)` block (lines 296–306) hides the desktop sidebar (`.sidebar` → `display: none`), and that the mobile drawer is revealed by `.mobile-header`'s default `display: flex` (line 271) being suppressed only under `@media (min-width: 768px)` (lines 285–290). PASS = both rule sets present and well-formed.
- [ ] **I11** Tap/click the hamburger menu. PASS: mobile sidebar sheet slides in from the left with navigation links.
- [ ] **I12** Tap/click the backdrop or a nav link. PASS: mobile sidebar closes.
- [ ] **I13** Tap a navigation link in the mobile sidebar. PASS: navigates to the target page and mobile sidebar closes. (Note: the drawer closes implicitly via page navigation — the next page loads in default-hidden state. No explicit close-on-link-click handler is required; navigation is the close trigger.)
- [ ] **I14** Open the mobile sidebar, press `Escape`. PASS: sidebar closes.
- [ ] **I15** Open the mobile sidebar, press `Tab` repeatedly. PASS: focus cycles through focusable elements inside the sidebar without escaping to the page behind it. `Shift+Tab` at the first element wraps to the last.

### Command Palette

- [ ] **I16** Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux). PASS: command palette overlay appears with search input focused.
- [ ] **I17** Type a search term (e.g. "ideas"). PASS: filtered results appear. Select a result — navigates to the corresponding page.
- [ ] **I18** Press `Escape`. PASS: command palette closes.
- [ ] **I19** Open command palette, type a search term. Use `Down Arrow` and `Up Arrow` to navigate results. PASS: active result highlight moves with arrow keys. Press `Enter`. PASS: navigates to the highlighted result.
- [ ] **I20** Open command palette with an empty search field. PASS: results list shows up to 12 items from the combined index, grouped by category (Ideas, Projects, Members, Pages) with category headers — when the dataset is sparse enough for multiple categories to fit in 12 items, multiple groups appear; otherwise a single group is shown. Type a multi-category term (e.g. "a", which matches across Pages / Ideas / Projects / Members) that matches across groups. PASS: results regroup under multiple category headers. Type a term that matches no results. PASS: result list is empty or shows a no-results message.

### Loading States

- [ ] **I21** Navigate to a data-dependent page with mock data loaded. PASS: loading skeleton (card-grid, card-list, or detail pattern) appears briefly before content renders.
- [ ] **I22** If an error occurs inside a `loadInto()` fetch path (e.g. a data-dependent page hits a thrown adapter error after the database initialized successfully), the error state with "Try Again" retry button is shown. PASS: clicking retry re-attempts data loading.

### Toasts

- [ ] **I23** Trigger a toast (e.g. save an idea). PASS: toast appears at top-center of the viewport (fixed to `top: var(--space-4); left: 50%; translateX(-50%)`), auto-dismisses after ~6 seconds with fade-out. (Toast position was migrated from bottom-right to top-center.)
- [ ] **I24** While a toast is visible, click its close button (×). PASS: toast dismisses immediately without waiting for auto-dismiss timer.
- [ ] **I25** Trigger multiple toasts in rapid succession (e.g. save an idea repeatedly). PASS: toasts stack visibly with the *newest at the top*, older ones flowing downward (`prepend` ordering, not `appendChild`). Up to 5 visible. When a 6th toast arrives, the *oldest* — at the bottom of the stack — is removed.

### General

- [ ] **I26** Confirm Snapshots is gone: sidebar
  has no Snapshots item; `snapshots/` is not a
  PAGE_REGISTRY page (unsigned load is the
  not-found page, not a restore UI). Historical
  I26 (download → wipe → upload) retired with
  the snapshots page.
- [ ] **I27** Check DevTools Console after navigating through 5+ different pages. PASS: no unhandled JavaScript errors (warnings and info messages from browser extensions are acceptable).

### Sidebar Cross-Tab Sync

- [ ] **I28** Open the app in two tabs. In tab 1 collapse the
  sidebar. PASS: tab 2 reflects the collapsed state without manual
  reload (cross-tab sync via StorageEvent on
  `fusion-angle:sidebar-collapsed`).

### Accessibility

- [ ] **I29 — Skip link & `<main>` landmark** From a fresh load of any sidebar-layout page, press `Tab` once. PASS: the first focusable element is a "Skip to main content" link (visually hidden until focused via the `.skip-link` translateY rule in `base.css`); pressing `Enter` moves focus past the sidebar and top-bar into the page body. Then confirm via `read_page`/`javascript_tool` that the content wrapper is a `<main id="main-content">` landmark (not a bare `<div class="page-content">`) and that the composed shell (`web-app/app/components-layout.html`) contains exactly one `<main>`. `Tab`/keyboard is MCP-driveable (see I15), so this is a PASS/FAIL case — not BLOCKED. Guards WCAG 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A).
- [ ] **I30 — Reduced-motion view-transition guard** (behavioral drive BLOCKED — `prefers-reduced-motion` cannot be emulated via the MCP, the same class of limit as `resize_window`/I10). Structural verification is authoritative and PASS-able: read the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block in `base.css` (it sits beside the `::view-transition-*` rules there), and confirm a rule neutralizes the page-content transition under reduced motion (e.g. `::view-transition-group(*)` / `::view-transition-old/new(*)` set `animation: none`) — the universal `*, *::before, *::after` reset does NOT reach view-transition pseudo-elements, which live in a separate tree rooted at `::view-transition`. PASS = the neutralizing rule is present and well-formed. Behavioral tier (BLOCKED): confirming `fade-in-up`'s `translateY` slide (`utilities.css:138`) is actually suppressed on navigation requires a human with OS-level reduced-motion enabled. Guards WCAG 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA).

## K. Objectives & Scoring

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

Owner agents: Agent-G (K1–K6 in Phase 2, K8 in Phase 4),
Agent-E (K7, K9–K23, K30), Agent-CH (K27–K29). Mutation
domain delta:

- Agent-G adds: `objectives/:id` document-trio PUTs
  (archive/reactivate ride the document body lifecycle
  trio — no shared `states` log; revision history is
  message-plane pairs at `objectives/:id/revisions/`)
- Agent-E adds: `projects/:id/objective-baseline-scores`
  and `projects/:id/objective-actual-scores` (message-plane;
  adapters `postProjectBaselineScoring` /
  `postProjectActualMeasurement`)
- Agent-CH stays read-only

### K1–K6 — Organization Objectives box (Agent-G, Phase 2)

K7 has been reassigned to Agent-E and appears at the end of
the K30 subsection. K8 is Phase 4 / alone — it MUST NOT
run in Phase 2 because it replaces the database via
process restart, which is shared across the seven Phase 2
agents.

**K1.** Open Organization page; confirm Objectives box
renders between the Overview and Usage cards with
4 seeded active objectives in position order. PASS if all
4 names display.

**K2.** Click `+ Add objective`; confirm modal opens. Enter
name "Test Objective" and description "Test desc"; click
Add. PASS if the new objective appears at the bottom of the
active list.

**K3.** Click `Edit` on an active objective; confirm modal
opens pre-filled. Change the name; click Save. PASS if the
list re-renders with the new name.

**K4.** Click `Archive` on an active objective; confirm
dialog opens. Confirm. PASS if the objective moves from
active to the Archived sub-section, with strikethrough.

**K5.** Click `Reactivate` on a archived objective; PASS
if it returns to the active list.

**K6.** Drag an objective to a new position. PASS if the
new position persists across a page reload.

**K8.** **Phase 4 case** — runs alone last after Phase 2
and Phase 3. Catastrophic if run in Phase 2 because it
replaces the database, which is shared across all seven
Phase 2 agents.

Empty state: stop the A3 process.
`./postgres-wipe --postgres local` then
`./postgres-seed --postgres local --bootstrap`
then start `node server.mjs`. Sign in with the
stdout admin credential. Open Organization. PASS:
the empty-state copy "No objectives yet. Add one
to get started." renders (bootstrap seeds org 1
with no objectives). Restore the shared garden
by stopping again, `./postgres-wipe --postgres
local`, then `./postgres-seed --postgres local
--mock-data`, then start.

### K9–K18 — Project detail: inline scoring + Approve (Agent-E)

The Score and Log-measurement MODALS are retired. Baseline
and actual scores are edited INLINE in
`#project-objectives-section`: each `.project-objective-row`
carries EITHER a `.baseline-slider` (before approval) OR an
`.actual-slider` (once approved) — mutually exclusive, selected
by project state — with one shared `Save`
(`data-action="save-objectives"`) button that enables only
when a slider moves off its `data-initial-value`. Precondition
note (TALLY.7): a project converted through the UI arrives at
`submitted` ALREADY baseline-scored (convert requires a
baseline per active objective), so to exercise the
unscored→score→approve path you need a project created
WITHOUT baselines (converted when no objectives existed, or
seeded directly).

**K9.** Open a `submitted` project; confirm the header
actions slot shows Edit (`#project-edit-btn` in
`.project-actions-slot`) and the review action bar
(`#project-review-actions` / `.action-bar`) shows Approve /
Decline / Send back and no View history (View history
appears only once approved or archived in the lifecycle
action bar), and the objective rows' baseline sliders are
editable inline (baseline editing is open across the
pre-approval states submitted/under_review/sent_back).

**K10.** Transition status to `under_review` via the edit
form. PASS if the baseline sliders remain editable inline —
there is NO Score button and NO modal.

**K11.** With baselines unscored, the `Approve` button is
disabled with a tooltip prefixed "Set a baseline score
before approving:" followed by the comma-joined names of the
unscored objectives (e.g. "Increase incomes, Raise customer
NPS"); each name falls back to its objective id when no name
is known. The convert-time gating STILL HOLDS even
though the modal is gone.

**K12.** Inspect the objective rows; PASS if each shows a
baseline slider inline in the section (no modal opens), at
its current or unset value.

**K13.** Drag two baseline sliders to non-zero values; PASS
if the shared `Save` button enables (dirty-tracked). Click
Save. PASS if the rows show the saved baselines and Approve
is **still** disabled because remaining objectives are
unscored.

**K14.** After save, PASS if the moved sliders' `Save`
button disables again (each slider's `data-initial-value`
resets to the saved value) and saved values persist on
re-render.

**K15.** Drag the remaining baseline sliders; Save. PASS if
the Approve button enables once every active objective has a
baseline.

**K16.** Click Approve; confirm dialog opens. Confirm. PASS
if status flips to `approved` and the action bar re-renders
with `Archive` / `View history`; the row `.actual-slider`s
become editable inline.

**K17.** Negative-score path: on an under_review project,
drag a baseline slider to the far left (-100). Save. PASS if
the saved value persists as a signed value (e.g. −100) and
View history (once approved) shows the negative score.

**K18.** "No-payload" save: with no slider moved off its
`data-initial-value`, the `Save` button stays disabled and
no new baseline-score pairs are written under
`projects/.../objective-baseline-scores` (pair count
unchanged via console).

### K19–K23 — Inline actual measurement + Archive (Agent-E)

**K19.** Open an `approved` project; PASS if the objective
rows' `.actual-slider`s are editable inline (there is no Log
measurement modal), pre-filled from the latest actual or
from the baseline when no actual exists yet.

**K20.** Drag one actual slider; click `Save`. PASS if the
row's actual value updates (persisted via
`postProjectActualMeasurement`) and the Save button
re-disables.

**K21.** Re-render the page; PASS if the moved actual slider
pre-fills with its latest actual value.

**K22.** The terminal action is `Archive`, not "Complete",
and the terminal state is `archived`, not `completed` —
there is no `completed` value in `PROJECT_STATES`. Click
Archive; PASS if a confirmation dialog opens.

**K23.** Confirm the archive. PASS if status flips to
`archived` and the action bar reflects the archived
project.

### K24–K26 — Projects list Projected Impact column (Agent-E)

**K24.** Open Projects list; PASS if the Projected Impact
column renders a value for each row — unscored projects show
"—"; scored projects show a signed value.
NOTE: the column header carries no visible text label (the
"Projected Impact" name is not rendered in the header row),
so identify the column by its position/content, not header
text.

**K25.** Sort by Projected Impact descending; PASS if rows
re-order accordingly (most-positive first).

**K26.** Filter to `under_review` status + sort by Projected
Impact descending. Precondition: the K seed carries two
`under_review` projects, each with four baselines and
distinct Projected Impact values (`k-project-under-review`
high, `k-project-under-review-2` low). PASS if both rows
render, ranked high first — the "review queue ranked by
impact" workflow we designed.

### K27–K29 — Dashboard Impact + Aggregates (Agent-CH)

**K27.** Open dashboard; PASS if four surfaces render: three
arc-gauge cards sharing one card shell (Time and Cost are ratio
arc-gauges; Impact is a bipolar arc) and an Objectives box
(below the grid, one gauge column wide; card title
"Objectives").

**K28.** Inspect the Impact gauge. PASS if:
- The arc has muted background visible at all values
- For a net-positive portfolio, value arcs sweep right and
  use green tones
- For a net-negative portfolio, value arcs sweep left and
  use red tones
- The "actual" tick is visually distinct from the baseline
  area (thinner / different opacity)

**K29.** From another tab, log a measurement on the approved K project
(`k-project-approved`, seeded with four baselines by
the admin). PASS if the Objectives box updates within
~1 second (BroadcastChannel `fusion-angle:data` + `subscribeProjectScoreChanges`); the
three arc-gauge cards refresh only on full page load.

### K30 + K7 — Project history modal & temporal name resolution (Agent-E)

K7 runs LAST in Agent-E's block, after K30. K7 verifies the
temporal-name-resolution invariant that K30 only describes;
it has a cross-agent prerequisite on K3 (Agent-G's objective
rename in Phase 2). The orchestrator embeds the polling
contract in Agent-E's dispatch prompt.

**K30.** Open an approved project's View history modal.
PASS if:
- Events render in chronological order
- Each row shows date, event kind, objective name (as it
  was at the event's moment), and detail
- After an objective rename (K3), historical events still
  display the OLD name; events after the rename show the
  NEW name
- Baseline revisions appear as their own event rows (not
  collapsed)

**K7.** After K30 has run AND Agent-G's K3 has executed
(verify via `objectives/:id/revisions/` document message pairs on
the message plane — or the history UI — that ≥1 revision
with a `name` change exists, confirming K3 ran), reopen
the project's history modal. PASS if events that predate
the K3 edit display the OLD objective name, not the new
one (temporal name resolution). If after 10 minutes no
rename revision appears, mark K7 BLOCKED with reason
"no K3 rename to verify against — Agent-G did not produce
the prerequisite in time".

## R. Records

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

Sidebar entry plus list/detail pages, attribute editor with
constraint sub-editor, flow binding, per-node attribute
panel, and the property-test gate.

Owner agent: Agent-F2 (Phase 2). The property-test gate
(R13–R14a) rides Agent-F2's own work orders, and the record
CRUD mutates message-plane document/join families —
`record-types` (+ nested attributes), `flows/:id/records`
bindings, and `record-types/:id/instances` — disjoint from
every other agent, so no write-domain collision.

- [ ] **R1** Sidebar shows a Records entry; click navigates
  to `records/`. PASS: under the active org (Stark, org 1)
  the list renders Customer Profile; Project Brief is
  seeded under org 2 and is correctly hidden here.
  Serial (A3 `--mock-data`, demo admin's active
  organization Stark): Customer Profile visible;
  Project Brief is org 2 and hidden. Parallel
  (A3 `--test-plan-slices`): Customer
  Profile and Account Review (the R21 subject;
  never edit it).
- [ ] **R2** Click "Add Record" (desktop) / "New Record"
  (mobile) → navigates to a create page
  (`records/create.html`) with Name and Description
  fields (not a dialog). Type values, click "Create Record".
  PASS: new Record appears at the bottom of the list and the
  app navigates to its detail page.
- [ ] **R3** Open Customer Profile detail. PASS: read mode
  shows name + description + attribute table sorted by
  sort_order + Bound flows (Customer Onboarding, Lead-to-
  Close) + Work orders using this Record list.
  Serial (A3 `--mock-data`, demo admin's active
  organization Stark): Bound flows are Customer
  Onboarding and Lead-to-Close. Parallel (A3
  `--test-plan-slices`): Bound flows list Customer
  Onboarding only; work orders are `#r1`–`#r3`.
- [ ] **R4** Click Edit. PASS: edit mode renders name input,
  description textarea, and one editable row per attribute
  with name input, type picker, options textarea (for
  select-typed), and constraint editor.
- [ ] **R5** Type a name into the pending-attribute input,
  then click "+ Add Attribute". PASS: a row is appended with
  default type `text`; an empty-name click is a no-op.
- [ ] **R6** Change a text attribute to `select`. PASS: the
  options textarea appears; the constraint picker offers
  only kinds applicable to `select` (i.e. nothing in the
  toy).
- [ ] **R6a** Add an attribute and change its type to `radio`. PASS: the type picker offers `radio` alongside text/number/select/date/checkbox, and selecting it reveals the same "Options (one per line)" textarea that `select` shows; `checkbox` and the scalar types show no options field.
- [ ] **R6b** Give a `select` or `radio` attribute zero options and click Save. PASS: the save is rejected — a "Failed to save Record" toast appears and the editor stays open, because the API validator requires at least one option for choice fields (the gate, not merely a disabled button). Add one or more options and Save; PASS: it persists and read mode shows the attribute's type.
- [ ] **R7** Add a `regex` constraint on a text attribute,
  set the pattern. PASS: constraint row appears with the
  pattern editable; the picker no longer offers `regex`
  for that attribute (toy implementation may always offer
  it — accept).
- [ ] **R8** Drag-reorder attributes — toy may not yet
  support; MARK BLOCKED if so.
- [ ] **R9** Remove an attribute via its trash button.
  PASS: row removed from the editor; not persisted until
  Save.
- [ ] **R10** Click Save. PASS: returns to read mode; the
  list reflects the new attribute set and constraint
  summaries.
- [ ] **R10a** Save a Record edit and watch the toast. PASS: exactly one "Record saved" toast appears — never a stack — and re-entrant saves are guarded (clicking Save repeatedly does not fire multiple saves or stack toasts). NOTE: the original 5-stacked-toast defect needed a slow save to open the race; the multi-attribute write is now a single batched table write, so the window is effectively closed and exercising the race deterministically may require artificially throttling storage.
- [ ] **R11** Open a flow (Customer Onboarding). PASS: flow
  header shows `Record: Customer Profile` dropdown
  selected.
- [ ] **R12** Open the Data Capture node panel. PASS: each
  ref row shows attribute name + Editable/Read-only picker
  + Required checkbox + remove (×) button; picker dropdown
  lists unreferenced attributes only.
- [ ] **R13** From workbox, open the gate-violation work
  order (`#gate0001`). PASS: current node is Data Capture;
  the action screen shows Company Name and Contact Email
  inputs (fillable path); empty submit is blocked — the
  page-module empty-required pre-check toasts "Please fill
  all required attributes" before the POST. The typed
  gate (`validateRecordTransition` on CURRENT-node refs)
  is the durable covenant; CLI pins it; constraint
  failures still surface via
  `WorkboxDetailPresenter.buildViolations` banner.
  Serial (A3 `--mock-data`): the work order is
  `#gate0001`. Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`):
  the work order is `#r1`.
- [ ] **R14** Fill Company Name + Contact Email, click
  submit. PASS: transition succeeds; work order advances
  to Review (does NOT demand Reviewer Notes — that is
  current-node only when leaving Review).
  Serial (A3 `--mock-data`): the work order is
  `#gate0001`. Parallel (A3 `--test-plan-slices`):
  the work order is `#r1`.
- [ ] **R14a** When a node references a `radio`-typed Record attribute, the workbox work-order detail renders it as a radio group — one `<input type="radio">` per option, all sharing the attribute name so only one is selectable — rather than a dropdown; selecting an option and transitioning records that value. NOTE: seeded mock data predates `radio`, so add a radio attribute, reference it Editable on a working node, and create a work order to exercise this.
- [ ] **R15** Open the R2-created Record's detail
  page — never Customer Profile (R16–R20 read it).
  Click Archive; confirm in the house dialog
  (`data-dialog-open="confirm-archive"`). PASS: a
  "Record archived" toast appears, the header badge
  reads Archived, and the Archive button is gone. On
  `records/` the card reads Archived, an Archived
  chip appears beside Active, and toggling the
  Active chip hides the card. There are no numeric
  counts on the chips.
- [ ] **R16** Open Customer Profile detail. PASS: an
  Instances section lists instances (id + readable values)
  or "No instances yet", with a "New instance" control.
  (mutation domain: `records` / instances under the type —
  Agent-F2 exclusive.)
- [ ] **R17** Click "New instance". PASS: an identifier is
  minted, PUT creates an empty instance (etag consumed),
  and the section enters edit mode with writable attribute
  inputs (readable non-writable attributes render
  read-only; unreadable omitted).
- [ ] **R18** Fill a writable field and click Save. PASS:
  `patchRecordInstance` succeeds with the held etag; the
  section returns to list mode and the new value appears.
- [ ] **R19** Concurrent-tab 412 recovery: open the same
  instance editor in two tabs; save a different value in
  tab B; then save in tab A. PASS: tab A surfaces "This
  instance changed underneath you — values refreshed;
  re-apply your edit", re-GETs fresh values + etag, and
  stays in edit so the operator can re-apply.
- [ ] **R20** Click Delete on an instance; confirm in the
  house dialog (`data-dialog-open` /
  `confirm-delete-instance`). PASS: instance disappears
  from the list; reopening the address is not available
  (spent id).
- [ ] **R21** ACL projection (member vs admin) on
  Account Review. As the R admin, click New instance:
  Owner Notes and Credit Limit both render
  `data-access="writable"`. Sign in as the R
  `member_*` credentials, open New instance: Owner
  Notes renders `data-access="readonly"`; Credit
  Limit is absent (`read_roles: ['admin']`). PASS:
  projection matches held roles; no ACL editing UI on
  this page (ACLs are set only by
  `PUT …/attributes/:id`). Serial (A3 `--mock-data`):
  set the roles by the nested PUT on a record no case
  edits.

## J. Teardown

tenant: none
parallel: no
global_lock: process
depends: AA, B, C, D, E, F, F2, FS, G, H, I, K, R, SV

- [ ] **J1** Stop the `server.mjs` process started in A3. PASS: process terminates.
- [ ] **J2** Remove the build directory (`rm -rf /tmp/fusion-test` or equivalent). PASS: directory removed.
- [ ] **J3** Verify the ZIP file remains on `~/Desktop` for archival. PASS: `fusion-angle-server-${SHA}.zip` exists.

## SV. Server (Node + Postgres)

tenant: required
parallel: yes
global_lock: none
depends: A

This is the default origin, not a second ceremony. A3
**is** SV1. B15 / B18 / B19 / B23 pin cookie-session
on the same process. Keep SV6–SV10 as the two-jar /
two-tab / stale-until-navigation pins.

Operator prerequisites:

- `POSTGRES_URL`, `JWT_HMAC_SIGNING_KEY`, and
  `HTTP_SERVER_PORT` set (required; no defaults; never
  logged)
- Wipe then seed: `./postgres-wipe --postgres
  local`, then serial A3 with
  `./postgres-seed --postgres local --mock-data`
  then `node server.mjs`, and parallel A3 with
  `./postgres-seed --postgres local
  --test-plan-slices` then `node server.mjs`.
  The SV hunter still skips SV1 and does
  not re-seed.
- Credentials print once on **stdout**, never HTTP
- One mint process — do not run two `server.mjs`
  replicas

Named residual: the backend emits
`pg_notify('fusion_events', …)` inside the write
transaction. There is no LISTEN and no SSE client. A
second browser looking stale until it navigates is
**PASS**, not FAIL. BroadcastChannel is same-origin
same-browser only. Do not file **SV10** as a
regression.

### Browser against the real server

- [ ] **SV1** Satisfied by A3 — do not re-run. PASS if A3 passed (listen + stdout seed reveal).
- [ ] **SV2** Open `http://localhost:$HTTP_SERVER_PORT/auth/index.html` (or follow the unsigned root hop to landing, then Sign In). Sign in as `demo@example.com` with the stdout password. PASS: the dashboard loads from this Node origin — pages and API are one process.
- [ ] **SV3** After SV2, inspect DevTools. PASS: Application → Cookies shows `refresh_token` as HttpOnly, `Path=/api/authentication`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Secure` (always, including `http://localhost` and `http://127.0.0.1`); `localStorage` has no `fusion-angle:authorization` key and no `refresh_token`; the sign-in token response JSON has `access_token` and no `refresh_token`. Access is memory-only; refresh is the cookie.
- [ ] **SV4** On the signed-in dashboard, reload (Cmd-R). PASS: stays authenticated — no bounce to `auth`. Boot cookie-refreshes via `POST /api/authentication/token` (`grant_type=refresh`, `credentials: 'same-origin'`).

### Two browsers / two identities / one database

- [ ] **SV6** Two cookie jars against the same origin (Chrome + Firefox, or Chrome + a Guest profile). In browser A, sign in as `demo@example.com`. In browser B, sign in as `sarah.chen@company.com` (stdout password; Sarah is Stark, same organization as the admin). PASS: both dashboards load; the sidebar member chips name different people; one Postgres, two sessions.
- [ ] **SV7** In browser A, create an idea with a unique title (Ideas → Create Idea → required fields → Submit Idea). In browser B, navigate to `ideas/` (or reload if already there). PASS: Sarah's list includes A's new idea — two identities, one database.

### Two tabs share the refresh cookie

- [ ] **SV8** Same browser profile as the admin session (SV2). In tab A, stay signed in. Open `dashboard/index.html` in a new tab B. PASS: tab B stays authenticated with no second sign-in — both tabs share the `refresh_token` cookie; boot cookie-refreshes.
- [ ] **SV8b** Two windows of the same profile, both
  on `ideas/`. Create an idea in window A. PASS:
  window B's list gains the card without a reload
  (BroadcastChannel `fusion-angle:data`).
- [ ] **SV9** In tab A, click Sign out. In tab B, navigate (sidebar click or reload). PASS: tab B lands on `auth` — logout cleared the shared cookie (`Set-Cookie` `Max-Age=0`); boot refresh cannot mint. (An already-painted tab B may still hold a live access token in memory until that navigation — that is the access-TTL covenant, not a failed cookie clear.)

### Named residual — stale-until-navigation

- [ ] **SV10** Re-sign browser A as `demo@example.com` if SV9 cleared that session. With browser B already sitting on `ideas/` (do not reload), create a distinctly titled idea in browser A. PASS / named residual: B's open list does not gain the new card until B navigates or reloads. There is no NOTIFY listener; BroadcastChannel does not cross browsers. A second browser looking stale until navigation is **not FAIL**. After B navigates or reloads, the card from this write is present (same pin as SV7).

## BLOCKED detail (known MCP limitations — NOT failures)
- <case ID>: <one-line reason>

## FAIL detail
(none) | <case ID>: <one-line symptom>

Mitigation specs:
- <path> | (none)

## Drift Candidates
| Case | Mode | Symptom | Likely cause |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
(none) | ... | ... | ...
```

A fully green run with no drift produces zero rows in FAIL
and Drift Candidates, a one-line BLOCKED list, and fits in
under 50 lines.

`BLOCKED` is reserved for known MCP environmental limits
(pointer-capture gestures, `resize_window`, file I/O).
`FAIL` is for real regressions. A case that "mostly passes
but one subassertion drifts" is scored PASS with the drift
noted in the Drift Candidates table — the agent surfaces;
the user adjudicates.

### Mitigation specs

After join, one markdown file per FAIL cluster under
`docs/superpowers/test-plan-mitigations/`. Product design
specs stay in `docs/superpowers/specs/`. Do not create the
directory until the first cluster exists. The master lists
paths in the summary. Implementing those specs is
tracked in `TODO.md`.
