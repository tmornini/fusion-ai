# Fusion AI — Test Plan

> **Encoding:** `- [ ]` = pending, `- [ ]` = PASS, `- [FAIL]` = failure (add note)

### Protocol

All sections are executed over HTTP — serve the unzipped build via
a local HTTP server (e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8080`).

### Execution Order

Sections A through AA establish a pristine environment and populate
it with data through the UI. Sections B through J then verify every
page renders correctly against that data. The plan is designed to
run as a single continuous regression pass.
