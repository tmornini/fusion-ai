# Architecture

Vanilla TypeScript with zero runtime dependencies. This
document covers the domain, data, API, presentation, and
convention layers. Storage shapes and state alphabets live
in [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md).

## Domain objects

Domain classes wrap entity + state: `Idea(entity, state)`
and `Project(entity, state)`; the member classes compose
parent + detail rows: `HumanMember(parent, detail, pii,
state)` and `AIMember(parent, detail, state)`. All expose
`stateValue()` — the
lifecycle stage is part of the domain object, not a
separate fetch the presenter has to reconcile. How a state
is displayed (badge label and class) is presentation
vocabulary, owned by the `*_STATE_CONFIG` maps in
`web-app/app/presenters/state-display.ts` and keyed by the
state alphabets in `api/types.ts`. `Idea` additionally
exposes `readinessValue()` and `isReady()` — readiness is
derived from required-field presence on every call.

Readiness is a derived property of the `Idea` domain
object, computed at instantiation from required-field
presence: `title`, `problem_statement`,
`proposed_solution`, `expected_outcome` all non-empty →
`'ready'`; any one empty → `'incomplete'`. Readiness is
not stored in the states log; `Idea.readinessValue()` /
`Idea.isReady()` derive per call.
`canBeSubmittedForReview()` gates on lifecycle
(`active` or `sent_back`) AND `isReady()`.

The terminal state for both human and AI members is
`'archived'`. Both kinds change lifecycle through the
member-detail State select, which records the chosen
state via `postHumanMemberStateChange` /
`postAIMemberStateChange` — one voice across kinds.

## Flow Canvas

The Flow Designer (`flows/detail.html`) renders an SVG
canvas with pan, marquee, drag, and edge connection. Its
full architecture — the layer split, the FSM seam, panel
and auto-fit reconciliation, the two-tier hazard predicate,
and the read-only stats variant — lives in
[FLOW-CANVAS.md](FLOW-CANVAS.md).

### Flow-graph storage seam

The live flow graph is **pair-plane only**. The retired
four-relation row plane (`flow_nodes`, `flow_edges`,
`flow_node_members`, `flow_node_attributes`) and the
`flow_versions` table are GONE (Phase Final). Graph truth
rides the flow document pair body: `graphDelta` (node/edge
upserts by stable id, node/edge `'deleted'` events,
member/attribute `'added'`/`'removed'` ledger events) and
`revivals` (undo restore). `deriveFlowGraphStates` is the
permanent consumer of those sidecars (SIDECAR-KEEP). A
work order freezes its own `flow_graph` blob inside the
work-order document pair at creation — a frozen value, not
a live relationship.

The **route is the single divorce point**. `GET flows/:id`
AND `GET flows` (list) reassemble `FlowWithGraph` from the
pair plane (`= FlowEntity & { graph }` — the read DTO).
Freeze, work-order creation, stats, the member-hazard
reader, and export all derive for free because they read
through `ctx.GET`; the client `getFlowGraph` adapter is
unchanged. Writes append pairs only (`tx`
`['requests','responses']`); ids and `at` are client-minted
(Idempotency), the author server-derived from the verified
token. Undo resolves its restore target SERVER-SIDE
(stack+pointer over this flow's document-pair history vs
its undo operation-pair history) and lands a restore
document pair with SERVER-computed `graphDelta`/`revivals`.

Cross-tenant fencing of graph history walks the pair plane
(`resolveOwningOrganization` flow-graph leg + the
write-ownership fence for org-scoped PUT/DELETE).

## Records

A Record is a named data shape: name + description +
ordered attributes + per-attribute constraints. A flow
binds to one Record via `flow_records` (one binding per
flow, app-enforced — no UNIQUE index on `flow_id`);
a Record can back many flows. Each per-node attribute
ref (`NodeAttribute`) points at one `record_attributes.id`
and carries a `mode` (`'editable'` or `'readonly'`) and an
`isRequired` flag. Hidden is structural: absence from the
node's `attributes` array.

Six attribute types: `text`, `number`, `select`, `radio`,
`date`, `checkbox`. Three constraint kinds: `regex` (text only),
`range_min` and `range_max` (number or date only). The
applicability rule has two enforcement sites:
`assertConstraintAppliesTo` at the row writer and the
editor filtering the kind picker.

The property-test gate at work-order transitions:
`validateRecordTransition(ctx, workOrderId, pendingValues)`
resolves the work order's CURRENT node from the ledger,
walks that node's attribute refs → Record attributes,
gathers stored values from the pair-plane field-values
derive (`stateFieldValuesForStateEvent` and kin), overlays
pending values from the form, and runs requiredness +
`validateAttributeValue`. The gate matches the workbox
action screen (current-node fields only) — target-node
required attrs are checked when the operator leaves that
node later. Returns aggregated `ConstraintViolation[]`.
`postWorkOrderTransition` throws
`RecordTransitionViolations` on non-empty results; the
workbox page module catches the typed error and surfaces
the violations banner.

The pure constraint runner is `record-constraints.ts`
(`validateAttributeValue`, `formatViolation`) — the gate
(`record-transitions.ts`) runs the validation; the workbox
presenter renders violations via `formatViolation`.
Extracted as a pure module so a future editor live preview
and a fuzz runner can share it too.

A work order's frozen `flow_graph` references
`record_attributes.id` directly. If a Record's attribute
is deleted while a flow that targets it is in flight, the
gate throws `node X references unknown attribute Y` rather
than silently coercing — versioned Record snapshots arrive
in a future iteration.

The user-facing vocabulary is strict: `Record` is the
definition, `Attribute` is one of its properties,
`Constraint` is a per-attribute predicate. The storage
term `entity` never appears in user-facing strings. UI
copy says "Work orders using this Record" rather than
"instances."

## Auth, Org-scoping & Identity

### Org-scoping at the gate (pair-plane first)

Every authenticated request runs org-scoped, riding one
request vessel — the server half of the Office of the
Context (`api/request-context.ts`). `handleRequest` mints
`IncomingContext` (requestId, method, pathname, **base**
adapter; the facade re-entry keeps the outer request's id
via the `x-request-id` header). The authentication step
enriches it to `AuthenticatedContext` (principal), and
`fenceRequest` (`api/request-auth.ts`) completes the
`RequestContext` — organization, live
`memberOrganizations`, and roles — each field set exactly
once. There is **no org-scoped adapter wrapper**: surviving
stores (`clients`, `requests`, `responses`) are global;
tenancy rides `uri_prefix` on the pair plane. Handlers
receive `ctx.base`. The org rides the VERIFIED token claim,
never the path; a flat (un-exchanged) token has none and
resolves via `identityDefaultOrganization`: the identity's
SET default org (`identity_default_organizations` ledger,
latest wins), else its PRIMARY membership org, else a 403 —
there is no global default to fall back on. Both
`memberOrganizations` (`callerOrganizationIds` →
`deriveMembershipsForIdentity`, Phase 13 Task 3) and `roles`
(`callerRolesInOrganization` → `deriveRoleGrants`, same
phase) derive FRESH from the pair plane on EVERY fenced
request — never a snapshot the token claim carries — so a
revoked membership or role stops access on the identity's
very next request, not when the token expires. Two covenants
bound the vessel: it never carries the bearer token
(authentication reads the header from the raw Request, so
the vessel stays loggable), and route handlers keep their
`(adapter, params, body)` contract — the route table is the
chosen boundary where the vessel hands the base adapter to
the handler, keeping handlers transport-free.

**Write-time cross-tenant fence.** Pair addresses are
per-org namespaced (`canonicalUriPrefix` from the VERIFIED
claim). A foreign-id PUT/DELETE on an org-scoped family
must still 404 (never invent a genesis in the caller's own
namespace). `writeOwnershipFenceFor` /
`assertWritableInOrganization`
(`api/write-ownership-fence.ts`) resolve ownership via
`resolveOwningOrganization` before the handler runs:
owner-null → genesis proceeds; foreign →
`EntityNotFoundError` (the same 404 bytes the retired
`OrganizationScopedEntityStore#assertMine` threw). Read
isolation is derivation: every derive filters by the
caller's org prefix / membership set. The HMAC signing key
is client-shipped, so this is demo-grade isolation until
the server tier.

#### History — the decorator era (retired Phase Final)

Through Phase 15, `OrganizationScopedEntityStore`
(`store-organization-scoped.ts`) filtered reads, stamped
org on writes, and 404'd foreign ids;
`organizationScopedAdapter` (`db-organization-scoped.ts`)
wrapped org-owned stores; `ParentScopedEntityStore` /
`ParentScopedStateStore` (`store-parent-scoped.ts`) resolved
leaf ownership through already-fenced parents. Phase Final
Stage B deleted those three decorator modules with
`EntityStore` and `StateStore`. The pair plane + write-
ownership fence is the as-built successor.

### Multitenancy model

`organizations` is the tenant root (pair-plane document
family); `memberships` is the identity↔org join (also
pair-plane). The members roster is DERIVED in the `members`
route handler — it filters the global members directory to
ids present in the caller's membership derivation (the
system member rides along unconditionally). Per-org roles
resolve via `currentRolesForInOrganization`
(`api/authorization.ts`): the latest action per
`(organization_id, identity_id, role)`, fenced to the
request's org, over `deriveRoleGrants`.

### Invitation lifecycle and acceptance

A `memberships` row is now born from an INVITATION accept —
the first live membership-write path (the ledger was
seed-only before). `invitations` (id, organization_id,
identity_id, at) is GLOBAL spine, pass-through, NOT
org-fenced: the invitee must read an invitation to an org it
is not yet in, so the row cannot hide behind the org fence.
Its lifecycle is event-sourced in the append-only `states`
log under the alphabet {pending, accepted, declined,
revoked}, keyed to the invitation id; current status is the
LATEST event, derived and never mutated — the row itself
persists as audit through every transition.

Grant (admin) appends `pending`. Accept (invitee) appends
`accepted` AND writes the real `memberships` row in the SAME
atomic ctx-batch, stamped with the INVITATION's org — not the
caller's active org. Acceptance is inherently a cross-org act
(the invitee acts on an org it does not yet belong to), so it
cannot ride the org-stamped write path. Decline (invitee)
appends `declined`; Revoke (admin) appends `revoked`.

The surface is dedicated facade request handlers on the BASE
(un-org-scoped) adapter — like
`identityDefaultOrganizationRequest` — bypassing the
admin-only `ROUTE_POLICY` with explicit guards:
grant/revoke and the sent-list require an admin role in the
relevant org; accept/decline and the invitee read require the
caller to BE the invitee (identity match). That identity
guard is what lets a non-admin invitee accept. The
identity-scoped read (`GET /invitations`) returns the
caller's own invitations plus latest state; the admin read
(`GET /invitations/sent`) returns the active org's pending
invitations. `invitations` joins the states owner-resolver
probe, so an invitation's lifecycle events resolve to the
invitation's org and stay out of every other tenant's
`/states` read.

`memberships` semantics are UNCHANGED: a row still means an
accepted member, and the roster, reachable-orgs enumeration,
and token exchange all read it untouched.

### Facade + enumeration

`/organizations/:org/:entity[/:id]` is a facade:
`facadeRequest` exchanges the caller's bearer for a token
scoped to `:org` (RFC 8693 self-delegation, membership-
fenced — a non-member exchange is a 403 minting nothing),
then re-enters the flat gate with the scoped token so the
existing handler is org-fenced automatically. `GET
/organizations` (`enumerateMyOrganizations`) returns the
caller's reachable orgs, derived fresh from the membership
ledger (never the possibly-stale token claim).

### Boot + org-switcher

`core.ts::scopeBootToActiveOrg` always scopes the session
before first render: enumerate reachable orgs →
`resolveActiveOrg` (the persisted
`fusion-ai:active-organization`, else
the identity's default org if reachable, else the first
reachable) → `postOrgSessionExchange` → install the scoped
token. The
sidebar org-switcher (`web-app/app/org-switcher.ts`) renders
its `<select>` only at ≥2 reachable orgs and re-scopes via a
FULL reload (boot re-exchanges from the persisted id, so no
mixed-org view survives the switch).

### Identity surface

Pages `identities` (list, `inSidebarNav`), `identity-detail`,
`identity-providers`, `identity-tokens` share `sidebarKey:
'identities'`. Adapters (`adapters/identities.ts` etc.):
`getIdentity`, `getIdentityRoster` (single-pass join of
identities + identity_pii + ai_members), `postIdentityCreation` (person →
identity + PII; service → identity + hashed `client_secret`).
The identity stores are the GLOBAL spine — creation is a
client-minted id + idempotent PUT, OFF the org facade.
Presenters mirror the member ones (PII via the `MemberPii`
tagged union, erased fallback at the call site). Erasure
splices `identity_pii` only; the identity, the member, and
every `member_id` reference survive.

## Server-tier deploy blockers

Every item below is INERT today: the whole store is client-side
IndexedDB in the page-runner's own browser, so there is no trust
boundary to cross. Each becomes a live exposure the moment the
backend is physically split out and the browser becomes an
untrusted client — this is the disclosure checklist that gates
that split. Several former entries are now mitigated client-tier
and listed separately below. An audit re-confirms each remaining
seam is still KNOWN (seam flag present, unwidened) and separates
any NEW exposure — see [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) § Security: KNOWN
vs NEW.

Remaining seams — no client-tier mitigation exists:

- **Client-shipped HMAC key.** `SIGNING_KEY_MATERIAL`
  (`api/access-token.ts`) is a constant in client JS, so any
  party with the bundle can mint a valid token — forgery is
  trivial. NO client-tier mitigation exists or is possible:
  whatever the browser holds, the browser's user holds. Every
  gate downstream of token verification (org fence, role
  policy, membership liveness) is therefore demo-grade
  isolation until the server tier relocates ONLY the key
  (client constant → server secret/KMS) and who-mints (browser
  → `/authentication/token`); the wire format, alg (HS256),
  and every caller signature stay put.
- **In-band credential reveal.** The mock-data seeder returns
  freshly-minted plaintext credentials in-band for a one-time
  reveal (only PBKDF2 hashes are stored). Demo-only by design;
  the in-band return is deleted at the server tier.
- **client_assertion jti replay.** JWS verification is real
  (below), but no ledger yet remembers a jti as spent, so a
  captured assertion replays until its `exp`. The replay
  ledger lands with the server tier.
- **Auth-free snapshot plane.** `BOOTSTRAP_ROUTES`
  (`api/request-auth.ts`) —
  `snapshots/schema|mock-data|bootstrap|import` — is
  bearer-exempt UNCONDITIONALLY: no bearer, no route policy,
  regardless of whether a schema exists. A deliberate dev-tier
  install/demo decision (the surface is local, ephemeral, and
  slated for removal), so an anonymous wipe/seed/import is
  intended, not a regression — the exemption was widened from
  the old schema-gated window on purpose. This is the LAST
  seam to leave standing: the whole `BOOTSTRAP_ROUTES`
  exemption MUST be removed or re-gated the moment the
  Postgres server tier lands, when the browser becomes an
  untrusted client and an unauthenticated wipe of a populated
  tenant store is catastrophic. Until then it is KNOWN and
  accepted; do not re-raise it.

Mitigated client-tier — the seam is narrowed in this codebase,
re-verified by the automated suite:

- **Token-exchange delegation** (`grantTokenExchange`,
  `api/authentication.ts`): self-delegation ONLY — a
  cross-party exchange (subject ≠ actor) is 403 until a
  delegation ledger exists. The claim shape (`sub`,
  `act.sub`) is frozen.
- **`client_assertion` JWS** (`api/client-assertion.ts`):
  really verified against the client's registered JWKS
  (RS256/ES256, WebCrypto) plus RFC 7523 claim checks.
- **500 fallback body** (`handleRequest`, `api/api.ts`): a
  fixed opaque `internal error` body; fault detail goes to
  the console, never the wire. Through Phase 11 this covered
  only the domain-boundary catch; a thrown pre-dispatch
  ownership-fence read (`fenceRequest` itself, or the
  field-values visibility / history ownership guards) still
  propagated unredacted. Phase 12 Task 1 closed that gap: the
  fence regions now share one redaction catch with the same
  fixed body, so the claim holds everywhere a request can
  fault. `MissingTableError` still re-raises past all three
  catches, recovered by `redirectIfMissingTable`
  (`web-app/app/core.ts`).
- **Route policy tiers** (`ROUTE_POLICY`,
  `api/authorization.ts`): `admin` everywhere plus a real
  `member` tier on the content surfaces; identity, credential,
  membership, and snapshot surfaces stay admin-only,
  deny-by-default.
- **De-membership latency** (`fenceRequest`,
  `api/request-auth.ts`): every fenced request re-derives
  membership from the ledger, so revoking a membership stops
  access on the NEXT request — the token's 15-minute org
  claim no longer rides out its TTL.

## API Layer (`/api`)

`api/` is the server tier — the REST/DB-schema request
handlers, currently running in-browser. Code that crosses the
client/server chasm lives one level out in `shared/` (a sibling
of `api/` and `web-app/`): the HTTP wire schema (`http-message/`,
its own `types.ts`) plus pure cross-chasm utilities
(`base64url.ts`, `crypto-safe-base62.ts`, `password-hash.ts`,
`ledger-reduction.ts`, `error-helpers.ts`). Both `api/` and
`web-app/` import `shared/`; `shared/` NEVER imports `api/`.

`api/types.ts` (domain types + shared aliases — `MemberId`,
`MemberEntity` parent + `Member` union (`HumanMember` /
`AIMember` / `SystemMember`),
`GraphNode.memberIds: MemberId[]`,
`GraphNode.attributes: NodeAttribute[]`, record/constraint
shapes, `StateEntity` as the **derived** event DTO, the
state alphabets, and `SYSTEM_MEMBER_ID`), `api/db.ts`
(`DbAdapter` + `TABLE_NAMES` = `clients`, `requests`,
`responses` only — [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) is the
authoritative list and per-column reference),
`api/store-history-entity.ts` (`HistoryEntityStore` — the
sole store class; backs all three tables; no tombstone
filter, no lifecycle log), `api/db-indexeddb.ts`
(production persistence tier), `api/db-localstorage.ts`
(demo tier), `api/db-memory.ts` (test impl), `api/api.ts`
(the HTTP gate — `handleRequest` plus the
`GET/PUT/DELETE/POST` helpers, **no module-level adapter;
threaded explicitly**), `api/routes.ts` (the route table —
document families plus the surviving state routes),
`api/mock-data.ts` (seeds pair-plane demo data — the
`'system'` member plus human and AI rosters as pairs),
`api/validators.ts` (wire/body validators still consumed by
`WRITE_RESPONSE_SPECS`, seed pair formation, and the gate).
The `DbAdapter` interface is the migration seam to Postgres.

Phase Final deleted every entity table and the dual-write
row halves. `EntityStore`, `StateStore`, and the three
scoping decorators are GONE. IndexedDB's own open is
UNVERSIONED, so an origin that already has a database never
re-runs `onupgradeneeded`: an EXISTING pre-Final origin keeps
dropped stores as harmless, unread orphans (gate 6 residual
— see SCHEMA.md § Orphan stores); only `deleteSchema` (a
full database delete) clears them on IndexedDB.

`web-app/app/adapters/init.ts` wires the production IndexedDB
adapter singleton (`initAdapter()` / `getDbAdapter()`); the
IDB connection opens in `initialize()`, which boot awaits.
`web-app/app/adapters/shared.ts` defines the `RequestContext`
interface and `createRequestContext(adapter, token)` — both
args are required; `sessionContext()` is the no-arg
convenience that defaults to the singleton adapter and
session token. Tests pass `createRequestContext` a
`MemoryDbAdapter`.

`api/routes.ts` covers the surviving state-route surface:
`GET states`, `GET entity-states/:id/history`, and
`GET states/:id/field-values`. All reads derive from the
message ledger: `GET states` →
`deriveStates(db, organization)` (five-source union),
`GET entity-states/:id/history` →
`deriveStatesFor(db, organization, entityId)`, and
`GET states/:id/field-values` →
`stateFieldValuesForStateEvent` (transition-fold
single-source, visibility via `stateEventVisibilityFor`).
Every verb on `/states/:id` is router 404 (the address
itself is retired). Phase 15 Task 7 also retired
`GET entity-states/:id` (current),
`PUT|DELETE states/:id/field-values/:fvid`, and
`GET|POST|PUT|DELETE flows/:id/versions[...]` — all
router 404. Lifecycle writes ride document-trio PUTs
and named ops (work-order create/claim/transition/
release, invitations), not a shared event-append
address. When no schema exists, non-entry pages
redirect to snapshots.

## Write-path derives (Phase 14)

### The view-accepting convention, generalized

Several write-path decision reads — "what is the CURRENT
state before I write?" — derive from the pair plane
(`requests`/`responses`) rather than a table read, so a gate
never trusts a stale row-plane snapshot the ledger has
already superseded. Earlier phases established the shape for
invitations, memberships, and identity tokens; Phase 14
GENERALIZED it to invitation lifecycle state, work-order
claim history, the member_id-echo head-reads, and
`state_field_values` (SFV).

The convention is small helpers, not a framework — no
`ViewAwareDerive` class: (a) every core takes `dbOrView:
DbAdapter`, the SAME type an open transaction's `view`
satisfies, so a core is callable both pre-tx (passed `db`)
and from WITHIN an already-open write-gate transaction
(passed `view`); (b) a core never opens its OWN nested
transaction (see below); (c) a core reads only the stores
its caller already listed in its own `transaction(...)`
call, never widening the caller's table set on its own
authority; (d) every write-gate read is ENTITY-SCOPED —
indexed or prefix reads (`getAllWhere('uri_id', ...)`,
`getAllWhere('uri_prefix', ...)`), never a whole-plane
`getAll()` of `requests`/`responses` on a hot path (the one
named exception is below); (e) a pre-tx call and an in-tx
call of the same core return byte-identical results, pinned
by drift/parity tests.

New Phase 14 cores riding this shape: `invitationOpStateFor`
+ `invitationLifecycleStatesFor` (`derive-invitations.ts` /
`derive-states.ts`, entity-scoped siblings of the
whole-ledger `invitationOpStates`/`deriveStatesFor`, wired
into `pendingInvitationFor`/`currentInvitationState`);
`workOrderClaimHistoryFor` (`derive-states.ts`, pair-plane
claim history — op pairs only: create/claim/transition/
release; the `states/:id` event-append arm is retired with
the address); `documentStateHeadFor` (`derive-states.ts`,
the one helper behind all four member_id-echo head-reads —
document-history only); and `stateFieldValuesFrom` /
`deriveStateFieldValueReferrers` /
`stateFieldValuesForStateEvent` (`derive-state-field-
values.ts`, SINGLE-SOURCE — transition-pair-folded field
values only, head-reduced by the shared `(at, id)` order —
backing both the `record-attributes` RESTRICT gate and
`GET states/:id/field-values`).

### Nested-transaction re-entry

`api/db.ts`'s `DbAdapter.transaction` documents nested
re-entry as a LEGAL subset case: "a nested view.transaction
re-enters this same tx; its tables must be a subset of the
outer set" — the same open `IDBTransaction` is reused, not a
second transaction opened inside the first (which IndexedDB
forbids outright). The write-path convention still FORBIDS a
derive core from opening one on its own initiative (rule (b)
above): every derive is written to accept whichever view its
caller already holds, so nesting is never needed to reach the
open tx, and a caller's own table list stays the single,
auditable source of truth for what one transaction touches.

### Document-plane 412 (sole conflict mechanism)

The DOCUMENT plane — every `flows/:id`-shaped save,
including undo's own restore write, and every other
document-trio PUT — detects a stale basis via the
`responses.follows` unique index: a racing write against
the same head throws `UniqueConstraintError`, mapped to
HTTP 412 by `handleRequest`, and the caller retries with a
fresh basis. The old STATE-plane 409
(`stateEventCollisionFromPairs` →
`LedgerImmutabilityError` on a re-put of an existing
event id) retired with the `/states/:id` address itself;
identical resends of a document PUT still converge via
the follows index, not a separate immutability class.

### SIDECAR-KEEP and undo-as-replay

Flow undo (`POST /flows/:id/undo`) resolves its restore
target SERVER-SIDE, pre-tx, by replaying this flow's own
`flows/:id` document-pair history against its own
`flows/:id/undo` OPERATION-pair history — a stack+pointer
replay, not a naive "N pairs back" count, since a genuine
save after an undo truncates the abandoned branch rather
than oscillating back into it. The cursor correlates by the
STORED REQUEST `at` (never the response `at`, independently
minted per pair) against the undo address's own
operation-pair `at` values. `graphDelta`/`revivals` still
land in the restore's own document-pair body feeding
`deriveFlowGraphStates`, exactly like an ordinary save's —
SIDECAR-KEEP names this MECHANISM persisting even though the
VALUES are now SERVER-computed rather than client-supplied
(the client cannot diff against a target it is never told;
no new GET route is sanctioned for this). `hasUndoHistory`
rides the flow's own `GET` response (a document-pair-count
signal, zero marginal reads). `flow_versions` consume
(undo) and publish (every content edit) both STOPPED on
the live path at Phase 14; Phase 15 Task 7 RETIRED the
routes and adapters (router 404); Phase Final DELETED the
table with the rest of the row plane.

### Three named deviations

Phase 14 recorded three deviations from its own plan rather
than silently reaching for a workaround:

1. **SFV RESTRICT whole-plane scan** (Task 6).
   `deriveStateFieldValueReferrers` reads
   `view.requests.getAll()`/`view.responses.getAll()` inside
   the RESTRICT write gate — a whole-plane scan rule (d)
   above otherwise forbids. No `attribute_id` index exists on
   the pair plane; transition-fold field values live on
   work-order op bodies with no cheaper entity-id source.
   Stands post-Final (pair-only RESTRICT).
2. **Region B / leaf SFV routes** (Task 7). Phase 15 RETIRED
   the leaf PUT/DELETE routes (and their Region B fence
   arm); the surviving GET field-values collection re-anchors
   visibility onto `stateEventVisibilityFor` (3-tier; see
   Phase 15 / Phase Final as-built below). Dual-write SFV
   writers are GONE with Final; the derive is single-source
   (transition fold only).
3. **Server-computed undo sidecars** (Task 8). "Client-owned
   graphDelta/revivals," read literally, is impossible under
   the server-side restore-resolution default: the client is
   never told the target it would need to diff against.
   Elected reading: "client-owned" names the WIRE SHAPE
   (every document pair, including undo's, carries these
   fields), not literally who computes the values — the
   SERVER now does, reusing the exact diff semantics
   `web-app/app/adapters/flow-mutations.ts` uses for an
   ordinary save, duplicated (not imported, per the `api/` →
   `web-app/` layering rule) into `api/flow-graph-diff.ts`.

### Flow tags: the first pair-plane-only document family

`flows/:id/tags/:name` (PUT/GET/DELETE, SIMPLE class) is the
first document family with NO backing table at all —
`postFlowTagDocumentOp`'s transaction touches only
`requests`/`responses`. A tag pins one flow document pair's
response id (`flow_response_id`, the tag's only body field);
GET replays the tag's own stored body, so a tag's pin
survives every later save of the flow it names. DELETE is a
marked tombstone (a `deriveDocumentsAt`-excluded head), never
a row splice — there is no row to splice. Registered in
`PAIR_WIRED_ROUTE_PATTERNS`; the locked write-class is
structurally MOOT for this address (`isLockedWrite`
exact-matches `family/:id`, never a 4-segment tag address).
No UI landed this phase (see [TEST-PLAN.md](TEST-PLAN.md));
the API surface is the sole coverage.

## Last readers → Phase Final as-built

Phase 15 re-anchored every remaining production decision
read onto the pair plane and retired four zero-caller
route families (DELETE NOTHING held through Phase 15).
**Phase Final DELETED the residual.** Dual-write row
halves stripped (Stage A); doomed tables +
`EntityStore` / `StateStore` + the three scoping
decorators deleted (Stage B); `clients` re-pointed to
`HistoryEntityStore`; `SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION` 2→3;
states-address retirement bumps 3→4 and deletes every
verb on `/states/:id`; seed absolute at
EXPECTED_PAIR_COUNT 1506 / bootstrap 13;
`simulateLatency` 4.

### Two claims (never collapse)

1. **HTTP-wire-silent on the entity surface** — route
   surface and every response byte of every derive-based
   GET and every `WRITE_RESPONSE_SPECS`-gated write are
   unchanged by the deletion. PRECISION: snapshot-payload
   routes (`GET /snapshots/schema`; `PUT /snapshots/import`
   inputs) change exactly as claim 2 describes — the same
   fact over HTTP, not an additional violation. The two
   seed routes' `SeededCredentials` bodies stay shape- and
   count-stable.
2. **Snapshot file-format contract** —
   `SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION` 2→3 plus the table-key set
   shrinking to `clients` + `requests` + `responses`. A
   pre-Final export is rejected by a post-Final import
   (`SnapshotVersionMismatchError`).

### Wire covenant (Phase 15 deltas still hold)

1. **Route retirements** → router 404 (including every
   verb on `/states/:id`; the old 405 exception is gone
   with the address).
2. **Fence strengthenings** (same 404 body shape):
   (2a) WP1 organizations self-as-owner; (2b) records
   hard-delete forgery closed.
3. **Write-path re-anchors** (claim graph, RESTRICT legs,
   invitation discovery, identity_pii, clients):
   pair-plane only post-Final.
4. **Dangling `state_event_id`** on transition-fold field
   values → 400 at the gate (forged clients only).

### Successor derives (as-built)

All view-accepting (`dbOrView`), entity-scoped where the
address family allows, opening no nested transaction:

- `workOrderDocumentHeadFor` — claim-gate `flow_graph` head
- `stateEventVisibilityFor` — 3-tier field-values fence
  (orphan | visible | hidden)
- `resolveOwningOrganization` — pre-dispatch ownership for
  `GET entity-states/:id/history`, plus the write-
  ownership fence for org-scoped families
- `flowGraphBindingsFromPairs` — RESTRICT graph legs from
  graphDelta

### Gate 6 re-homes + survivors

- Invitation grant email → `deriveIdentityPiiRows`
- `pendingInvitationFor` / `loadInvitation` →
  `deriveInvitations`
- Client credentials → `rawReadRow('clients', …)` on the
  KEPT `clients` table (`HistoryEntityStore`)
- **`identity_providers` table DELETED** (Phase Final gate
  1 default) — derivation only
- Follow-on note: client = kind-`'service'` identity +
  registration facet is a server-tier client-registration
  phase candidate

### Addressability election

MEASURE-AND-ACCEPT stands. Claim/echo history remains
under the ~17ms re-election trigger at seed scale. Fence
hit/miss stays the same class (~27µs / ~2.0ms post-Final
measure). No entity_id index; no IndexedDB migration
primitive (first future ADDED store/index is the
watch-point).

### Exit residual (named, not dual-write)

Gate 6 **PII orphan residual** (leave-inert stands): see
SCHEMA.md § Orphan stores (gate 6) — the single canonical
statement. Dual-write mechanics are GONE.

## Storage tiers

`StorageBackend` (`api/db.ts`) is the byte-level seam:
`transaction(tables, mode, fn)` is the primitive every row
op crosses, and `ensureTables` / `hasSchema` /
`postSchemaCreation` / `deleteSchema` are schema lifecycle.
`HistoryEntityStore` owns history-row semantics (no
tombstones; hard splice only where a path still needs it —
PII erasure on the message plane); backends own persistence
and encoding. `BackedDbAdapter` (`api/db-backed.ts`)
composes one backend into the full `DbStores` bundle
(three stores).

Three backends implement the seam:

- `backend-indexeddb.ts` — the production tier, wired by
  `db-indexeddb.ts`. It is the ONLY file that names
  `indexedDB.*` (the divorce point). `transaction` runs a real
  `IDBTransaction` that commits on `oncomplete` and aborts on a
  thrown body, so a batch applies whole or not at all; schema
  presence is a `__schema__` marker store.
- `backend-localstorage.ts` — the demo tier, wired by
  `db-localstorage.ts`. It SIMULATES the transaction via
  `backend-buffer-tx.ts` (buffer touched tables, flush on
  success, discard on throw); schema presence is table
  existence.
- `backend-memory.ts` — the test tier, wired by `db-memory.ts`,
  simulating the same buffer transaction in process.

The simulated tiers share the buffer-then-flush helper so the
test backend cannot lie about what the production gate
enforces. The one property only IndexedDB provides is OS-atomic
multi-key commit — see the snapshot-import note in CLAUDE.md.

## Page Module Pattern

Every entry in `PAGE_REGISTRY` declares both `sourceDir` and
`sourceFile` explicitly (e.g., `flow-detail` →
`web-app/flows/detail.ts` + `web-app/flows/detail.html`).
The most common values are `index`, `detail`, `create`, and
`convert`. Each page module exports:
- `init(): Promise<void>` — fetches data, populates DOM
  placeholders, binds event listeners

Sidebar-layout pages have `index.html` containing page content
that gets composed with the layout template. Standalone pages
have a complete hand-written `index.html` with a
`<div id="page-root">` that `init()` renders into.

Notable registry entries:
- `flow-stats` → `web-app/flows/stats.ts` + `stats.html`
  (read-only flow heat map; sidebar layout;
  `searchable: false`).
- `members` → `web-app/members/index.ts` + `index.html`
  (single list grouped Humans / AIs; filter chips, search,
  `+ Add Member` dialog with a Human/AI kind picker).
- `member-detail` → `web-app/members/detail.ts` +
  `detail.html` (dispatches by `member.kind` to the human
  or AI detail presenter; `searchable: false`).

## Presenter Pattern

Presenters in `web-app/app/presenters/` are immutable view
objects: constructor takes the full data shape, methods return
`SafeHtml`. Page modules instantiate them and inject the result
into the DOM — presenters never touch the DOM, never fetch,
never mutate.

Editable detail views split into two presenters: a read presenter
(takes the entity) and an `*Edit` presenter (takes entity + draft
shape). The page module owns a `PageState` discriminated union
(`{kind: 'reading'} | {kind: 'editing', draft}`) and constructs
the appropriate one per render. This pattern applies to `Idea`,
`HumanMember`, `AIMember`, and `ProjectDetail`. The
`member-detail` page module reads `member.kind` and dispatches
to the right pair: `HumanMemberDetailPresenter` /
`HumanMemberDetailEditPresenter` for humans,
`AIMemberDetailPresenter` / `AIMemberDetailEditPresenter` for
AIs (the AI edit presenter renders a provider-grouped model
pulldown and a skill-focus textarea; no token field).

`presenters/index.ts` is the barrel; page modules import from
`'../app/presenters/index.ts'`. `WorkboxDetailPresenter` uses a public
`buildPage()` orchestrating private `#build*` helpers; the rest
expose `build*` directly.

`FlowStatsPresenter` (`web-app/app/presenters/flow-stats.ts`) is
the read-only counterpart to `FlowDesignerPresenter`. It exposes
pure `build*` helpers (`buildShell`, `buildStepperBar`,
`buildLegend`, `buildCard`) returning `SafeHtml` for testability,
plus DOM-touching `renderShell` / `renderUpdate` / `renderCard`.
It is flow-name-agnostic by design — the page module writes the
flow name into the header after `renderShell`,
keeping the presenter's `buildShell` / `renderShell` output
independent of presentation strings.

## Import Conventions

Page modules import directly from source modules, not through a barrel:

```typescript
import { $ } from '../app/dom.ts';
import { html, setHtml } from '../app/safe-html.ts';
import { showToast } from '../app/toast.ts';
import { buildSkeleton, buildErrorState } from '../app/loading-states.ts';
import { iconPlus, iconTrash } from '../app/icons.ts';
import { navigateTo, openDialog, closeDialog } from '../app/core.ts';
```

`core.ts` re-exports from `format.ts`, `navigation.ts`, and
`dialog.ts` so page modules can import `navigateTo`,
`initials`, `formatDateTime`, `formatCompactCurrency`,
`SECONDS_PER_DAY`, `openDialog`, `closeDialog`, `initTabs`
from `'../app/core'`. The `adapters/` directory retains
its barrel re-export (`adapters/index.ts`).

**Page modules never import from `api/api.ts`** — all data
access (reads and writes) goes through the adapter layer
(`adapters/`). Only adapter modules import from the API
layer directly.

## Naming Conventions

- `mutate*` — finds existing DOM and updates it (side-effecting,
  distinct from `build*` which constructs and returns)
- `toneFor*` / `levelFor*` — return string enums consumed as
  `data-tone` / `data-level` attribute values (replaces older
  `styleFor*` inline-style pattern)
- `assert*` — validators in `api/types.ts` and
  `api/validators.ts` that take a raw value and return a typed
  value or throw. The `is*` type-guards remain for legitimate
  type-narrowing call sites.
- Adapter reads are two-tier, named by what they return:
  the **domain noun** read returns the domain object
  (`getProject` → `Project`); where a raw stored-shape read
  also exists it carries the **Entity** suffix
  (`getProjectEntity` → `ProjectEntity`). Never table
  vocabulary (`Row`/`Rows`).

## Adapter Conventions

- **Member domain split.** Members are one parent table
  (`members`: id, type) plus per-kind detail tables
  sharing the id (`human_members`, `ai_members`).
  `adapters/members.ts` composes humans (parent +
  `human_members` detail); `adapters/ai-members.ts`
  composes AIs (parent + `ai_members` detail).
  `adapters/members-union.ts` is the
  union seam: `getMembers` is the roster (humans + AIs,
  never `'system'`); `getMemberMap` additionally resolves
  the system member so a system-authored event's author
  has a name; plus `memberName` and `isHumanMember` /
  `isAIMember` / `isSystemMember`. Import the union for
  kind-agnostic display; per-kind modules for status
  mutations and AI model/skill-focus storage.
- **`memberName(memberMap, memberId)`.** Throws on missing
  and unknown ids. Optional member references branch at the
  call site (`row.member_id ? memberName(...) : ''`); do not
  overload with a fallback. UI renders `'—'` via
  `DISPLAY_ABSENT`. Do not use magic strings like `'Unknown'`.
- **`RequestContext` is the only I/O surface.** Every data-
  access adapter takes `ctx: RequestContext` first and uses
  `ctx.GET/PUT/DELETE/POST/commit`. The standalone
  `GET/PUT/...` exports in `api/api.ts` are the transport
  `ctx` delegates to — adapters never import them directly.
  Each verb dispatches its own request with its own per-op
  transactions: two awaited reads on one ctx are NOT a
  snapshot — a write (same tab or cross-tab) can land
  between them.
- **Platform-shim vs data-access adapters share `adapters/`.**
  Data-access adapters (`ideas.ts`, `flow-queries.ts`, etc.)
  fetch entity data through `ctx`. Platform shims
  (`clipboard.ts`, `viewport.ts`, `location.ts`, etc.)
  wrap browser primitives behind adapters the app owns.
- **`getFlowStats(ctx, flowId)`.** Resolves the work-order
  set via the `flow_work_orders` join table (its `flow_id`
  column), since the frozen `flow_graph` carries no flow id
  of its own. Returns `{ model, graph }` so the page derives
  the canvas viewBox from real laid-out coordinates —
  `getFlowGraph` runs `computeLayout` for `is_auto_layout`
  or degenerate flows.
- **Mutation adapters return `Promise<void>`.**
  Change-awareness flows through notification channels (e.g.,
  `ideaChanges.notify()`), never through return values —
  callers tell the channel rather than branch on a result.
- **Records adapters.** `adapters/records.ts` owns Record
  lifecycle (CRUD + `postRecordStateChange`).
  `adapters/record-attributes.ts` exposes
  `getRecordAttributesByRecord`, sort-ordered.
  `adapters/flow-records.ts` is the binding seam
  (`getRecordForFlow`, `getFlowSummariesForRecord`,
  `getWorkOrdersForRecord`).
  `adapters/record-transitions.ts` orchestrates the
  property-test gate via `validateRecordTransition`;
  `postWorkOrderTransition`
  (`adapters/work-orders-mutations.ts`) runs that gate and
  throws `RecordTransitionViolations` on a non-empty result.
