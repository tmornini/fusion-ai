# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Dev Commands

```bash
./build              # Compile, bundle, minify, and create distribution ZIP
```

No test framework is configured.

## Architecture

**Vanilla TypeScript** with zero runtime browser dependencies. This is an enterprise innovation management platform with modules for ideas, projects, teams, and analytics (Edge, Crunch, Flow). Every page is a standalone HTML file that works via both HTTP server and `file://` (double-click any `index.html`).

### Key Layers

- **HTML Composition**: A build step (`site/compose.ts`) merges `site/layout.html` (shared sidebar/header) with each page's `index.html` to produce standalone composed `index.html` files in a temp build directory. 8 standalone pages have hand-written `index.html` that are copied directly to the build output.
- **Navigation**: Standard `<a href>` links between pages. Parameterized pages use query strings (`?ideaId=1`). `navigateTo(page, params?)` helper constructs relative URLs for programmatic navigation.
- **Layout**: Dashboard pages share a layout template with sidebar, header, search, notifications, and theme toggle. Mobile layout uses CSS media queries (not JS) to swap between desktop sidebar and mobile drawer.
- **Page Detection**: `<html data-page="dashboard">` attribute is read by JS on `DOMContentLoaded` to dispatch to the correct page module's `init()`.
- **Auth**: Mock auth returning `demo@example.com`.
- **Data**: All mock data is in `site/data.ts` with ~27 async functions returning Promises — ready for API replacement.
- **State**: Simple module-level variables + pub-sub pattern for theme (persisted to localStorage), mobile detection (matchMedia), auth, and sidebar state.

### Page Module Pattern

All page folders uniformly contain `index.ts` and `index.html`. Each `index.ts` exports:
- `init(): Promise<void>` — fetches data, populates DOM placeholders, binds event listeners

Dashboard pages have `index.html` containing page content that gets composed with the layout template. Standalone pages have a complete hand-written `index.html` with a `<div id="page-root">` that `init()` renders into.

### Dark Mode

CSS custom properties on `:root` (light) and `[data-theme="dark"]` (dark). Toggle persists to `localStorage` and carries across page navigation. Supports system preference detection via `prefers-color-scheme`.

## UI & Styling

### Component Library

All UI components are vanilla HTML/CSS with ARIA attributes, defined as CSS classes in `site/style.css` and helper functions in `site/script.ts`. No external component library.

### Design System

Full spec in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. Key constraints:

- **Colors**: Primary Blue `#4B6CA1`, Primary Yellow `#FDD31D`. Never use pure black `#000` — all grays are blue-tinted. All colors defined as CSS custom properties.
- **Typography**: Display = IBM Plex Sans, Body = Inter, Mono = IBM Plex Mono. Self-hosted woff2 files in `site/fonts/`.
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system.
- **Icons**: ~80+ inline SVG functions in `site/script.ts` (replaces Lucide React). Each returns an SVG string: `iconSparkles(size, cssClass)`.
- **Toasts**: `showToast(message, type)` function with auto-dismiss.
- **Charts**: SVG rendering functions in `site/charts.ts` (bar, line, donut, area).
- **Dark mode**: CSS custom properties with `data-theme` attribute.

### Mobile Responsiveness

CSS media queries in `site/style.css` show/hide desktop vs mobile header and sidebar. Mobile sidebar uses Sheet (slide-in drawer) toggled by JS. Breakpoints: sm 640px, md 768px, lg 1024px, xl 1280px.

Each page directory contains `index.ts` + `index.html`. Build output goes to a temp directory — no build artifacts in the repo.

## Build

The `build` script requires a clean git working directory (no uncommitted changes), then:
1. Composes HTML pages: runs `site/compose.ts` to merge `layout.html` with each dashboard page's `index.html`, producing 18 composed files in a temp build directory
2. Copies 8 standalone pages' `index.html` to the build directory
3. Bundles TypeScript into a single IIFE (`site/app.js`) via esbuild into the build directory
4. Copies static assets (`site/style.css`, `site/fonts/`, `index.html`) to the build directory
5. Creates a distribution ZIP (`fusion-ai-<sha>.zip`) on `~/Desktop`

No build artifacts are created in the repo — everything is assembled in `/tmp/`.
