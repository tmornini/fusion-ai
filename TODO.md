# TODO

The single home for later work. An item leaves this
file by shipping; `## Close protocol` is the exit.

## Critical path

Twelve items, in this order — each its own brainstorm →
spec → plan → ship cycle, implemented sequentially. A
"Merged:" clause names bullets absorbed from
`## Later work`; they keep their oracles.

1. Restore the genesis-wins-under-skew covenant — five
   drift/derive tests name a clock-skew case they never
   construct, so they pass for the wrong reason.
   `tests/drift-ideas.test.ts:600` ('GET idea trio is
   lifecycle-current under clock skew') seeds a genesis PUT
   at `2026-05-01`, then a later-arriving PUT at
   `2020-01-01`, and asserts the trio keeps the genesis
   `state_at` / `state_event_id`. But its fixture
   `ideaDocument(title, state, stateAt, stateEventId,
   position)` never writes `stateAt` or `stateEventId` into
   the body — the whole-tree type check flagged both unused
   (TS6133), and they now carry the `_` prefix that records
   the omission. No skew is ever built, so nothing the name
   claims is exercised. Same shape in
   `tests/drift-objectives.test.ts:1199`,
   `tests/drift-projects.test.ts:558`,
   `tests/drift-records.test.ts:1093`,
   `tests/drift-states.test.ts:1436`, and
   `tests/derive-projects.test.ts`. Two exits per the Office
   of Verification: make the PUT path accept caller-supplied
   trio values so the skew is real, or rename the tests to
   the arrival-order covenant they actually keep. The first
   is a validator change; neither is confined to one test's
   subject. Found by the whole-tree type check.
2. Remove the lifecycle trio — fold `state` /
   `state_at` / `state_event_id` out of every document
   body (Decision 7): the reduction
   (`api/derive-documents.ts:148-157`), the stamp
   (`api/document-family.ts:118`), every derive
   (`api/derive-ideas.ts:54, 83`,
   `api/derive-projects.ts:39, 70`,
   `api/derive-flows.ts:75`), the seeds
   (`api/mock-data/seed-message-pairs.ts:733, 913`),
   and the validators' trio-key gates; lifecycle
   becomes its own event rows. Merged: no lifecycle
   transition table at any gate.
3. Credentials out of the message; views for the app —
   hoist `Authenticate:` (ideally the only plaintext
   credential path) into its own column; a view that
   omits it and omits deleted rows; a schema-owner
   role and view-only application roles (read-only,
   write-only, read-write), none able to read the
   column. Merged: token-at-rest hashing (closes KNOWN
   seam "A raw dump still has verbatim auth
   messages" — `tests/api-shadow-ledger-auth.test.ts`);
   two-role views
   (`tests/backend-postgres.test.ts:391`); physical
   PII erasure (closes KNOWN seam "Erased PII persists
   as superseded pairs" —
   `tests/api-pii-tombstone.test.ts`); the in-band
   plaintext comment at `api/mock-data.ts:151-152`
   (owner call).
4. Cachability — headers, `HEAD`, conditional
   requests, and the rest; the brainstorm presents its
   questions from most to least desirable. Start:
   `server/http-server.ts` `NO_STORE` and
   `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY`.
5. `/status` — `{ up: boolean, components: {
   postgres: boolean } }`; `up` is true when every
   component is; built for more components. Item 10's
   health probe.
6. Re-implement workbox, work orders, and flows —
   nodes become processes; process kinds: record
   modification (current), external process
   synchronization (new), directed cyclic graph (flow
   and sub-flow), directed cyclic graph (sub-graph); a
   chat on every record and work order (consumes item
   8). Merged: READY gate on dangling refs
   (`tests/adapters-flow-publish.test.ts`); locked
   verbs not executed
   (`tests/family-registry.test.ts`); the flow-tag
   designer UI (`TEST-PLAN.md:1510-1511`); F6's ZIP
   import not rebinding `flow_records`
   (`TEST-PLAN.md:1114`); the canvas seams the
   remediation leaves — page selection writes behind
   the FSM, its four selection-writing sites
   (`web-app/flows/detail.ts:369, 403, 559, 1854`),
   in-place `viewBox` mutation at four method sites
   (`web-app/app/presenters/flow-designer.ts:537, 556, 1012, 1042`),
   `hasUndoHistory` as `pairs > 1`
   (`api/derive-flows.ts:108`), rotation only on the
   toggle path (`web-app/app/flow-layout.ts:1032-1037`),
   and the mirror trigger.
7. Headless AI worker — a server-side process that
   watches each AI process-worker's workbox, claims,
   assembles the record definition, the attribute
   values (which — decided in the brainstorm), the
   node instructions, and whatever else serves, asks
   the model to follow them precisely, and applies the
   reply: attribute updates in record-PATCH form and
   the outgoing edge. API-only. Merged: roster seat
   naming an AI agent
   (`tests/family-registry.test.ts:112-113`);
   FLOW-CANVAS.md's display-only AI checkboxes
   (`FLOW-CANVAS.md:130-132`);
   `withNodeTaskInstructions` already stores the
   instructions.
8. Chats at `/api/chats` — attachable to any document
   at `/…/:collection/:id/chat` with as little
   ceremony as the plane allows.
9. Genericity — DRY, even once (the indulgence); spec
   away every nit. Merged: `putRecordInstance` PATCHes
   (name lie —
   `tests/adapters-record-instances.test.ts`,
   `tests/api-instances-create.test.ts`); same-body
   PATCH appends 201
   (`tests/api-instances-create.test.ts:585-586`);
   member detail's redundant GET trio
   (`web-app/members/detail.ts`); two zoom
   implementations and two constant sets
   (`web-app/app/flow-fsm-reduce.ts:12-14, 632-656`,
   `web-app/app/flow-interactions.ts:16-18, 816-850`);
   `#noteMutation` / `history()` beside
   `advanceHistory`
   (`web-app/app/presenters/flow-designer.ts:221-227`);
   four hand-kept copies of the reveal key set
   (`api/test-plan-slices.ts:122-139`,
   `server/seed.ts:174-203`,
   `tests/pg-seed.test.ts:348-353`); the second
   instances the remediation added (`formRExtras`'
   record create, `canvasFocusOf`'s walk); the undo
   path's duplicated pure helpers
   (`api/flow-graph-diff.ts:16-26`); the dead
   `FK_SPECIAL` map
   (`web-app/app/schema-svg.ts:100-110` — remove the
   comment at `schema-svg.ts:100-110` when done);
   `callerOrganizationIds`, zero callers
   (`api/request-auth.ts:189-197` — remove the comment
   at `request-auth.ts:189-191` when done); the
   test-only `deriveRecordStateHistory` alias
   (`api/derive-record-types.ts:185-189` — remove the
   comment at `derive-record-types.ts:185-189` when
   done); the `#flowDesc` stub
   (`web-app/app/presenters/flow-stats.ts:414-417` —
   remove the comment at `flow-stats.ts:414-415` when
   done); `toRecordAttribute`'s `??` ACL default
   (`web-app/app/adapters/record-attributes.ts:76-79`)
   and the two readings of an absent role array
   (`api/routes.ts:843-856, 1000-1005` —
   `recordAttributeDocumentBodyOf` vs
   `attributeSchemaOf`); the nested
   key-set follow-on (`api/validators.ts:705-713` —
   remove the comment at `validators.ts:705-713` when
   done); `handleSpace` dispatching
   `isFormFocused: false` unconditionally; Delete's
   `preventDefault` with nothing selected.
10. Production readiness, repository and Render —
    block cross-environment connections,
    high-availability app and Postgres, and the rest.
    Merged: the single-mint-process KNOWN seam's
    precondition — record the claim-expiry decision as
    its own event before any multi-process deployment
    (`api/derive-states.ts:811-823` — remove the
    comment at `derive-states.ts:811-823` when done);
    the `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` throttle seam
    (`tests/http-throttle.test.ts`);
    stale-until-navigation once there are processes to
    notify (`tests/advisory-lock.test.ts`). Consumes
    item 5.
11. Fewer JSON parse/stringify — byte-stream header
    setting, mechanical sympathy and simplicity for
    the processor; measured first
    (`./measure --profile`). Merged: the deferred
    content-coding seams
    (`shared/http-message/body.ts:76-79` and
    `shared/http-message/content-coding.ts:5-7` —
    revise both comments when done).
12. Simulated latency by environment — when
    `FUSION_ANGLE_ENVIRONMENT` is exactly `local` and
    `FUSION_ANGLE_LATENCY` is a millisecond count,
    both present and non-empty, every API request
    takes the existing log-normal sampler
    (`api/latency.ts:18-40`) with
    `mu = ln(FUSION_ANGLE_LATENCY)`; otherwise the
    no-op. Merged: the shim's "both presets pass a
    no-op today" (`api/latency.ts:1-5`,
    `api/db-backed.ts:31-32`, `api/api.ts:2133-2134` —
    revise the three comments when done).

## Later work

Off the critical path; each with its oracle.

- One client 401-recovery voice through
  `redirectToLogin()` with `?return=` —
  `tests/adapters-http-facade.test.ts`
- Toast pause on hover and focus
- Mock seed's fixed 2026-06-15 anchor — after
  2026-09-13 serial-mode FS3 carries in-flight heat
  only
- Profile as its own document,
  `identities/:id/profile`, 404 = no profile — closes
  whole-or-none — `tests/api-identity-document.test.ts`
- Roster rows carry a fabricated empty profile
  (`emptyPersonProfile`) —
  `web-app/app/adapters/members.ts:48`
- `DEFAULT_DIM` stands in for an assessment that never
  happened — `web-app/members/index.ts:52`
- The re-mint refresh is not single-flighted with the
  facade's cookie refresh —
  `web-app/app/adapters/shared.ts:463-464`
- `./measure` harvests error-page timings;
  `page:ready` carries no status —
  `web-app/app/measure.ts`
- The cross-party delegation ledger
  (`api/authentication.ts:884-886`;
  `tests/api-authentication-token.test.ts:678`)
- Passkey, provider-IdP, and corporate-OIDC ceremonies
  (`api/authentication.ts:1595-1597`;
  `tests/api-authentication-authorize.test.ts:225`)
- Per-client multi-audience, DPoP `cnf`, jti reuse
  detection (`api/types.ts:508-510`;
  `shared/access-token-decode.ts:30-31`)
- SP-6 sign-up (`web-app/auth/index.ts:655-663`)
- Billing (`web-app/billing/`)
- Invitation email delivery
- The `≥ N` doc debt (`TEST-PLAN.md:131-132, 185-186`)
- Attribute drag-reorder (TEST-PLAN R8)
- Idea-create toasts an incomplete submit; convert
  still sets `btn.disabled` — two forms, one
  directory, opposite validation voices
  (`web-app/ideas/create.ts:124`,
  `web-app/ideas/convert.ts:356`;
  `docs/superpowers/test-plan-mitigations/`
  `2026-08-26-d-d6.md`)
- The run-four remediation's remaining seams — the
  Objectives sparkline track collapses at 304px
  (`web-app/app/styles/components-metrics.css:80-82`);
  archived records in the flow-header dropdown
  (`web-app/flows/detail.ts:1391-1402`,
  `renderBindingSlot`); Edit rendered for members on
  record detail
  (`web-app/app/presenters/record-detail.ts:495-500`);
  the binding PUT not probing record existence
  (`api/routes.ts:5583-5586`); R12 without a positive
  subject; stale G9 / R6 / R7 notes
- A replay is indistinguishable from a creation. The
  gate's replay branch renders a previously-stored
  pair but passes `appended: true`
  (`api/api.ts:1013-1015`), so `sendWriteResponse`
  (`api/message-pair.ts:610-624`) answers 201 exactly
  as the genuine create did. THE FIX IS WIRING, NOT
  DELETION: pass `false` there. The 200 branch is not
  dead — the unchanged-live-PUT site already passes
  `false` (`api/api.ts:1412-1413`), which is both the
  proof the distinction was designed and the precedent
  for the repair; an item reading "remove the 200
  branch" would be exactly backwards. Below the gate,
  the same blindness: `appendMessagePair` skips a
  duplicate `request_hash` silently by its own comment
  (`api/message-pair.ts:686-701`), and the composed
  operation wrapping it still answers 201 however many
  inner pairs actually landed
- A shared test operation id can produce false greens.
  `tests/http-fixtures.ts:12` exports one hardcoded
  `TEST_OPERATION_ID`; 135 test files use it, 99
  through a local `req()` helper that pins it. Because
  `appendMessagePair` dedupes on `request_hash`, a
  test issuing two byte-identical requests has the
  second silently dropped — which made a security test
  in the run-four remediation pass against unfixed
  code until it was caught. Oracle:
  `tests/api-record-types-composed-op.test.ts:434-440`
- Absence and emptiness are conflated in attribute ACL
  derivation. `attributeSchemaOf` synthesizes
  `readRoles: []` both for a head that deliberately
  stores an empty array and for one carrying no role
  keys at all (`api/routes.ts:1000-1005`), because the
  nested attribute PUT appends the raw wire body
  rather than the validator's normalized document
  (`api/routes.ts:5307-5333`; the default-stamping it
  discards is `api/validators.ts:3042-3054`)
- A panel rename whose target is deleted during the
  800 ms debounce still saves and still clears redo.
  `withNodeNamed`, `withNodeTaskInstructions`, and
  `withEdgeNamed` fire `#queueSave` and `#noteMutation`
  unconditionally, so an `applyUpdateNode` that matches
  nothing still ships a phantom idempotent PUT and a
  spurious redo clear — a disclosed trade-off, not a
  regression. Oracle:
  `web-app/app/presenters/flow-designer.ts:808-885`;
  the debounced schedules are
  `web-app/flows/detail.ts:1349-1391`
- A flow loaded with Auto Fit OFF no longer fits on
  first paint. `withCanvasSize`
  (`web-app/app/presenters/flow-designer.ts:996-1017`)
  fits only under `isAutoFit`, and the load-time block
  (`web-app/flows/detail.ts:1685-1697`) is the only
  load-time fit — its `reconcileFitFromDom()` returns
  early for the same reason. RECORDED, behavior
  unchanged. The sentence it falsifies is "onFlowLoaded
  keeps its explicit first fit" — the run-four
  remediation design spec, second-commit paragraph
- The Deno migration as one block — six specs, strict
  1 → 6, 3 and 4 may swap after Spec 2's measurements,
  Spec 6 optional (the measurements after Spec 5
  decide); the roadmap is `9620d38c`
- Stale-history comment cleanup as one pass — about 35
  code and 32 test comments describe a past state as
  present; the enumeration is the run-four
  remediation's Evidence
- Cryptographically verifiable ledger — brainstorm
  hash-and-verify (or sign) of stored pairs. The dropped
  `version` column hashed on write and was never checked
  on read. `request_hash` is replay identity, not
  response integrity — `SCHEMA.md` item 4
- The add-identity dialog never clears its fields —
  AA-Obj's stale-state sibling —
  `web-app/identities/index.ts:213-281`
- `flows/stats.ts` wires no change subscription; the
  stats page stays stale until navigation
- The empty-state `onEmpty` removes the header create
  button irreversibly; a live empty→populated re-init
  (run-six Task 9) leaves the list without its header
  CTA — hide, don't remove —
  `web-app/ideas/index.ts`, `web-app/records/index.ts`
- Claim-on-load with no release-on-leave plus the
  8-hour `DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT` turns a drive-by
  work-order view into an 8-hour claim
  (run-six Task 3 renders it; the UX remains) —
  `web-app/workbox/detail.ts:583-593`,
  `api/types.ts:1007`
- G/V5 needs a cross-slice identity to verify Decline,
  or the case text should sanction any invited
  identity — plan defect vs explorer slip, unresolved —
  TEST-PLAN.md G/V5
- Intermittent "flow-marquee" console exceptions on
  non-canvas pages (Billing) — a flow-canvas gesture
  listener may be bound globally — TEST-PLAN.md G42
  observation
- A re-init failure degrades weaker than a first-boot one:
  `subscribeOnce`'s `void fn()` lets the rejection reach the
  global `unhandledrejection` handler, which logs and
  toasts — but first boot gets `handlePageLoadError`'s full
  error state with a Try Again button. Toast-only, no retry
  — `web-app/app/channels.ts:152`,
  `web-app/app/page-loader.ts:41-75`,
  `web-app/app/error-helpers.ts:41-57`
- `subscribeOnce` guarantees "never two" live subscriptions,
  not "always one": a bell arriving between teardown and
  re-arm is dropped, leaving an empty list page blank — the
  symptom run-six Task 9 fixes. Needs two bells inside one
  fetch window; a pending flag would close it but
  reintroduces the shared state the design avoids —
  `web-app/app/channels.ts:138-154`
- Objective lifecycle history compares two clocks:
  `revision.at` is client-minted while the lifecycle `at`
  is the server-stamped pair fact. A browser clock ahead of
  the server can invert them and throw, so the History
  modal fails to open with an error toast instead of
  rendering —
  `web-app/app/adapters/objectives.ts:311`,
  `web-app/projects/detail.ts:318`
- `api/test-plan-slices.ts` forms a record write in three
  near-verbatim ~100-line blocks — `formAaRecord` (:2026),
  `formRecordBindingMessagePairs` (:2445), and the first
  fifty lines of `formRExtras` (:1830); past the rule of
  three, extract the no-binding core once
- The resolve-and-throw block in
  `web-app/app/presenters/project-score-history.ts` is four
  identical 11-line copies (:139, :161, :182, :201) — a
  `#definitionAt(objectiveId, at)` helper collapses each
- `tests/ideas-empty-subscribe.test.ts` enforces its
  load-bearing property by comment, not assertion: assert
  the two raw PUTs alone do not wake the page before
  posting the bell
- `tests/presenter-project-score-history.test.ts:224,:259`
  assert substrings the row-selection predicate already
  implies, leaving the detail cell unpinned — assert
  `<td>archived</td>`
- `tests/test-plan-slices.test.ts:466-472` pins the AA
  attribute count but not names or types; a rename keeps it
  green while invalidating AA33 (`TEST-PLAN.md:970`)
- Untested by design after run-six: the records/projects/
  flows `onEmpty` arms (only ideas is pinned), `loadInto`'s
  retry branch, a work order both claimed and completed,
  and the archived-genesis walk
  (`web-app/app/adapters/objectives.ts:190-192`)
- `subscribeOnce`'s `const unsubscribe = subscribe(...)`
  would throw a TDZ ReferenceError if any `subscribe` fired
  its callback synchronously; all thirteen
  `subscribe<Entity>Changes` delegate to `createChannel`,
  so it is inert — guard only if that changes
- Run-six cosmetics, none load-bearing: the only
  human-readable seed id among 560
  (`api/test-plan-slices.ts:208`), `unknown[]` returns now
  provably narrower (`api/document-family.ts:438,:445`), a
  non-strict DESC pin
  (`tests/api-entity-history-routes.test.ts:1033`),
  `adminId` hard-coded where siblings parameterize it
  (`api/test-plan-slices.ts:2040`), and a dead
  `disconnect()` stub in
  `tests/ideas-empty-subscribe.test.ts`
- Investigate `docker compose up -d --wait` postgres
  only. Not the compose `server` — that would be a
  second origin (`compose.yaml`)
- Node-only modules by directory — once whole-tree type
  checking ships, the browser tsconfig's `exclude` is
  the last hand-kept registry (seven, growing with the
  tiers plan). Move them out of `web-app/app/` into a
  top-level tools directory so browser membership is by
  rule and the top level names the tools. After the
  tiers plan. Oracle: `web-app/app/tsconfig.json` has
  no `exclude`
- A DOM-free server universe — `server/` and the `api/`
  it reaches type-check only under `lib.dom`, so a
  `document` in server-side code is invisible to `tsc`.
  Measured at `8cad9e86`: `server/` alone under `ES2024`
  + `@types/node` reports 8 errors, all WebCrypto/Fetch
  names that `lib.webworker` carries without `document`
  (`api/client-assertion.ts:29-167`,
  `api/message-pair.ts:540`). A third project over
  `server/` extending the root with
  `lib: ["ES2024", "WebWorker"]`; verify `@types/node`
  coexists. Oracle: a `document` reference in `api/`
  fails `./validate`
- The browser tsconfig at `web-app/app/` is the nearest
  project only for `web-app/app/**`; editors and the
  LSP open `web-app/flows/**` and the other page
  directories under the root superset, where `process`
  resolves. Move it to `web-app/tsconfig.json`. Six
  live references (`validate`, TEST-PLAN.md AT1,
  AGENTS.md's Gates paragraph, AGENTS.md's Two type
  universes invariant, `tests/tsconfig-covenants.test.ts`,
  and this file's own Node-only-modules-by-directory
  Oracle above) plus the tiers plan's path
- GPU flag in the Layer 2 launcher — `launchChrome`
  no longer passes `--disable-gpu` (cargo cult under
  `--headless=new`; it was required only by old
  headless on Windows). Its one real effect was
  forcing software compositing, which made runs more
  alike across machines. Dropped UNVERIFIED —
  `./test-browser` has run green on one machine
  (2026-08-28). Restore it if two machines disagree.
  Oracle: `./test-browser` green on two machines
- TEST-PLAN covenants with no test — the 2026-08-29
  audit's gap list. Each names the lowest layer that
  could express it. The walk observes these; nothing
  proves them.
  - A real `./build` run — its exit code, the ZIP it
    writes, and that ZIP surviving the walk, plus the
    artifact's contents: the 29 `PAGE_REGISTRY` files
    (the eight A2 names, `api-documentation/index.html`
    among them), `server.mjs`, `assets/app.js`,
    `assets/styles.css`, the woff2 fonts, the 18 page
    directories, and the verb/status rooms generated
    separately from `PAGE_REGISTRY` (A1, A2, J3) — Layer
    1, an integration test in the shape of
    `tests/crank-cli.test.ts` that spawns `./build
    --no-zip` into a temp dir; today
    `tests/server-zip-metafile.test.ts` only regex-checks
    the build script's source text
  - The mock-data reveal's 11 printed lines carry
    `demo@example.com` and `sarah.chen@company.com` by
    name, not merely a count of 11 (A3) — Layer 1,
    `tests/pg-seed.test.ts` `'mock-data seed prints every
    human sign-in'`; every `demo@example.com` assertion
    there sits on a `'bootstrap'` call or the synthetic
    formatter test
  - The live root redirect — exactly one transition, and
    a navigated URL that is never `auth/` or `snapshots/`
    (A4) — Layer 2, a CDP test under `tests/browser/`;
    `tests/root-redirect.test.ts` is a source-text regex
    a computed destination would evade
  - No console error and no 501 during a real
    unauthenticated page load (A5) — Layer 2, a CDP test
    capturing console messages and the network log
  - Create Project stays disabled while only SOME active
    objectives are scored (AA22, AA22a) — Layer 1, a
    `conversionIsReady` fixture in
    `tests/presenter-idea.test.ts` with two or more
    objectives partly baselined; today's fixtures are
    N=1, which cannot tell `.every()` from `.some()`, or
    N=2 all scored
  - The Add-Member dialog's Kind toggle, default-Human
    selection, and the AI form's disabled-until-Model
    Create gate (AA4, AA7a) — Layer 1 or 2;
    `bindAddMemberDialog` (`web-app/members/index.ts`)
    carries no test
  - The live seat-derived roster and the Ideas list's
    membership and counts against the real mock seed —
    which humans and which idea titles render on Stark
    (AA6, AA7, AA12, AA14) — Layer 1, a boot-level test
    in the spirit of `tests/mock-flow-readiness.test.ts`
  - The Projects list count after a live idea-to-project
    conversion, seeded 16 plus 1 (AA24) — Layer 1,
    chaining `postIdeaConversion` into
    `getProjects().length` in
    `tests/adapters-projects.test.ts`
  - The flow designer's toolbar and header chrome — Undo,
    Redo, Zoom −/+, Copy Mermaid, Export ZIP, Delete, and
    the Locked / Auto Layout / Auto Fit switches (AA26) —
    Layer 2; no presenter test enumerates these labels
  - Every member unassigned on a brand-new node, the
    `memberIds: []` shape (AA28) — Layer 1, one more
    assertion in `tests/presenter-misc.test.ts`'s
    `'buildNodePanel marks currently assigned member
    checkboxes as checked'`
  - The 800 ms auto-save debounce timing itself (AA29,
    AA40) — Layer 2, measuring the delay between a
    properties-panel edit and the resulting PUT
  - A renamed node's own name surviving a save and reread
    (AA29, AA40, F30) — Layer 1, an assertion on
    `graph.nodes` by id in
    `tests/adapters-flow-mutations.test.ts`'s `'putFlow
    persists every FlowSaveShape field'`
  - The Create-node edge group rendering `data-edge-ref`
    and deliberately no `data-edge-id`, which is what
    keeps it non-interactive (AA30) — Layer 1, a render
    test over `web-app/app/flow-graph.ts:869-882`
  - The attribute list item's rendered mode label
    (Editable / Read-only) and required-toggle state
    (AA33, AA34) — Layer 1, a presenter test on the
    properties panel's attribute-list render; only the
    `performAddAttributeRef` write is tested
  - The landing CTAs carrying `[data-goto-auth]` and
    navigating to `auth/index.html` on click (B2, B3) —
    Layer 2, a browser test on `web-app/landing/`;
    `tests/landing-stay.test.ts` finds the string in the
    page source but ties it to no element
  - The auth form's client-side validation messages —
    "Email is required", "Please enter a valid email
    address", "Password must be at least 6 characters"
    (B6, B7, B8) — Layer 1, by exporting `validateEmail`
    and `validatePassword` from `web-app/auth/index.ts`
  - The exact rejection string "Invalid email or
    password." (B9) — Layer 2;
    `tests/browser/sign-in.test.ts` checks only
    `error.length > 0`
  - The Sign Up mode toggle's title, field, and button
    changes, and the "Sign-up is coming soon" toast with
    no navigation (B10, B11) — Layer 1, the same export
  - A 401 after sign-out being the revocation ledger
    rejecting a presented credential, not merely a
    request with no cookie (B24) — Layer 1, an API test
    that revokes through the ledger while a live access
    token is still in play; the two-jars pin shares one
    cookie jar, so a cleared cookie alone explains its
    bounce
  - `resolveOrganizationGate(nonEmpty, <a gated page
    other than invitations>)` returning the list (B28) —
    Layer 1, one more assertion in
    `tests/boot-organization-gate.test.ts`; a mutation
    proved the old pin false
  - A header landmark and a main-content region rendering
    on `dashboard/` (C1) — Layer 2, extending
    `tests/browser/sidebar.test.ts` or
    `tests/browser/sign-in.test.ts`; the sidebar and the
    dashboard load are pinned, these two are not
  - The sidebar's 12 links in the stated order, labeled
    (C2) — Layer 1, asserting `PAGE_REGISTRY`'s
    `inSidebarNav` titles equal the 12-item order
    verbatim; one exclusion is checked today, never the
    order or the full set
  - The header's search bar, stats tiles, and theme
    toggle, and the retired greeting and org `<select>`
    being truly absent from the live DOM (C3) — Layer 2;
    `mutateHeaderInfo` mutates `document` directly and
    has no pure-function seam
  - The visual order of the four dashboard surfaces and
    the painted dual-concentric and bipolar arcs (C4) —
    Layer 2, reading the rendered SVG arc paths
  - Each sidebar link's click actually navigating to its
    target page (C5) — Layer 2, clicking each
    `PAGE_REGISTRY` sidebar link and reading
    `location.pathname`
  - The sidebar staying fixed while the main content
    scrolls (C6) — Layer 2, reading the sidebar's
    bounding rect before and after a scroll
  - The mock seed's per-org and global entity and roster
    counts landing in their stated bounds — ~6 ideas, ~16
    projects, ~4 flows, 6 humans, 4 AIs, ~11/~17/~5
    globally (C7) — Layer 1, a `sharedMockDb()`-backed
    test beside
    `tests/adapters-dashboard-mock-seed.test.ts`, which
    covers only the Impact and objective baselines
  - The six conversational prompt labels on the create
    form — "Give your idea a clear title" and its five
    siblings (D5) — Layer 1, an assertion on
    `IdeaCreatePresenter`'s rendered label text; the
    cited test reads field values, never the fixed
    strings around them
  - The read-mode Problem & Solution card's exact field
    set and its em-dash-for-empty-optional rendering
    (D11) — Layer 1; `presenter-idea.test.ts` excludes
    `renderShell`/`renderUpdate` by choice, and
    `makeRecordingContainer`
    (`tests/presenter-project-detail-impact.test.ts:30`)
    already renders a DOM-slot shell under Node
  - The Edit → editable-inputs toggle and Cancel
    restoring the original (D12, D14) — Layer 2;
    `handleIdeaActions`'s edit and cancel branches are
    driven by nothing
  - The composed header action-button SET per idea state
    — Send Back / Approve / Edit together for
    `in_review`, only Edit otherwise, and only Cancel /
    Save in edit mode (AA18, D15, D29, D32, D32a) — Layer
    1, a presenter test rendering
    `IdeaPresenter`/`IdeaEditPresenter`'s action slot end
    to end; today only the state predicates
    (`isReviewable`, `canSubmit`, `isConvertible`) are
    unit-tested in isolation
  - A `promoted` idea's badge label reading exactly
    "Promoted", not "Approved" (D24) — Layer 1, a
    `promoted` fixture in `tests/presenter-idea.test.ts`;
    `IDEA_STATE_CONFIG`
    (`web-app/app/presenters/state-display.ts:35`) is
    untested
  - `promoted` and `archived` ideas never getting a
    filter badge even when present (D25) — Layer 1, a
    `renderBadges` fixture including one; only their
    absence from the candidate list is source-confirmed
  - The `aria-pressed="true"` highlight on the selected
    filter badge (D26) — Layer 1, one more assertion on
    the lit case the dimmed test already builds
  - The convert page's error state (D35) — Layer 1;
    `web-app/ideas/convert.ts:96-115` hand-rolls its own
    `buildErrorState` call outside the shared `loadInto`
    helper, and `buildErrorState` has no test anywhere
  - The "New Idea" button, the create-form Cancel, and
    the convert-page back button — each a click then
    `navigateTo` (D4, D9, D34) — Layer 2; no test drives
    any click handler on any ideas page
  - A live drag on any list but projects — the ideas list
    (D36, D37) and an objective row (K6) — and a new
    objective's own "appears at bottom" placement (K2) —
    Layer 2; `tests/browser/list-reorder.test.ts` drags
    `[data-project-card]` and nothing else
  - The org-scoped projects list count landing at its
    stated lower bound with the paint-timing wait honored
    (E1) — Layer 2, waiting on the card count before
    asserting
  - The per-metric absent-placeholder rule — which of
    Time, Cost, and Impact produced the em-dash — on the
    list card's `project-metric-grid`
    (`ProjectPresenter`'s `#buildMetrics`, which no test
    reads) and on the detail page (E1, E4) — Layer 1,
    three fixtures in
    `tests/presenter-projects-organization.test.ts` each
    zeroing one baseline; the only candidate today
    searches the whole rendered shell and finds Impact's
    em-dash whatever Cost holds
  - The live status-badge click and its active/pressed
    styling (E2) — Layer 2
  - Clicking a project row landing on
    `projects/detail.html?projectId=<id>` (E3) — Layer 1,
    a `buildPageUrl('project-detail', { projectId })`
    case in `tests/navigation.test.ts`, whose detail-page
    cases name only `idea-detail` and `idea-create`
  - The project detail page's dates and progress bar
    rendering with data (E4) — Layer 1, extending
    `ProjectDetailPresenter`'s coverage in
    `tests/presenter-projects-organization.test.ts`
  - The absence of a Team card on the project sidebar
    (E5) — Layer 1, an exclusion assertion on
    `ProjectDetailPresenter.renderShell`
  - The "Flow creation limited to approved projects only"
    and "No flows yet" empty-state copy painting for a
    zero-flow project (E6) — Layer 1, asserting that
    paragraph directly; the New-Flow-button test passes
    `flows: []` for both branches and never reads it
  - The New Flow dialog's fields — Flow Name input,
    Create / Cancel — and the live navigation into the
    designer after Create (E7, AA26) — Layer 2, driving
    the dialog on an approved project's detail page
  - The live click swapping read mode for edit mode on
    project detail (E8) — Layer 2
  - The live click-Save round trip on project detail (E9)
    — Layer 2
  - Edit then Cancel restoring the original, unmodified
    data (E10) — Layer 2; the cancel branch is inline in
    `handleProjectActions`, mutating a module-level
    `state` variable, unlike the exported, tested
    `reduceProjectSave`
  - `#project-review-actions` and
    `#project-lifecycle-actions` carrying `hidden` while
    editing and reappearing on Cancel (E10a) — Layer 1;
    no test names either id
  - The drop indicator's appearance and the card
    following the pointer mid-drag (E11) — Layer 2,
    extending `tests/browser/list-reorder.test.ts` past
    the before/after order
  - The import dialog's Project selector, hidden file
    input, and Choose-File trigger (F4) — Layer 1, a
    markup test over `web-app/flows/index.html` in the
    shape of `tests/flow-detail-toast-overflow.test.ts`
  - The ZIP resolution dialog's four shapes — Overwrite,
    Create New, Create, and the description (F6, F44) —
    Layer 1, a pure test of `buildDialogConfig`
    (`web-app/app/adapters/flow-export.ts`), already pure
    and only unexported
  - Which node kind wears which colour, the Archive
    node's red 3-px border, the centred special label,
    and the attribute-count subtitle (F8, F40, AA26) —
    Layer 1, per-node `buildGraphSvg` assertions in
    `tests/flow-graph-locked.test.ts`; `'an unlocked
    canvas keeps per-type strokes'` renders all three
    kinds into one blob and asserts each token appears
    somewhere, so a green-for-red swap survives it, and
    cycle amber (`WARN`,
    `web-app/app/flow-graph.ts:47`) is asserted nowhere
  - The cycle edge's rendered `stroke-dasharray` and
    `url(#flow-arrow-warn)` marker (F9, F21) — Layer 1, a
    `buildGraphSvg` assertion on a graph with a back-edge
  - `canShowPort`'s three-way rule and the port's
    `<title>` copy (F10) — Layer 1, `buildGraphSvg` with
    a wired and an unwired Create node, locked and
    unlocked
  - The connect preview's markup — the "New State" ghost
    card, the grey straight line, and the bezier with its
    arrowhead (F15, F19, F23) — Layer 1,
    `buildConnectPreview` via `buildGraphSvg`
  - Auto Fit's refusal on the zoom BUTTONS (`withZoomedIn`
    / `withZoomedOut` under `isAutoFit`) and the 0.25
    `MIN_ZOOM` clamp (F29) — Layer 1,
    `tests/flow-designer-presenter.test.ts` for the
    buttons (only the wheel path is covered) and
    `tests/flow-fsm-reduce.test.ts` or
    `tests/flow-zoom-to-fit.test.ts` for the clamp
  - The pixel-identical position restore across an undo
    (F34) — Layer 1, asserting `positionX`/`positionY`
    after the undo in `tests/flow-undo-cursor.test.ts`
  - Backspace as a delete chord —
    `reduceDesignerShortcut` handles `Delete ||
    Backspace` in one branch and only `Delete` is
    asserted (F38) — Layer 1, one more `chord({ key:
    'Backspace' })` case in
    `tests/flows-detail-shortcuts.test.ts`
  - The Delete toolbar button's `disabled` attribute
    under lock (`FlowDesignerPresenter#canDelete`) and
    the attribute picker's own `disabled` attribute when
    locked or when nothing is free (F40, F71) — Layer 1,
    `tests/flow-designer-presenter.test.ts` and
    `tests/presenter-misc.test.ts`
  - The "Mermaid copied to clipboard" toast and the
    clipboard write itself (F41) — Layer 2,
    `tests/browser/toasts.test.ts`
  - The real archive round trip — the four-entry manifest
    as a set, `flow.json` and `flow.txt` in particular
    (F42), and members and attribute refs surviving
    `getFlowZip` → `getBackupFromZip` (F6, F44) — Layer
    1, `tests/adapters-flow-export.test.ts`; its own
    tests read back only `flow.mmd` and `sidecar.json`,
    and the members-and-attributes round trip builds its
    backup as an in-memory literal
  - The canvas itself changing after each Undo, as
    distinct from the server state (F45, F46) — Layer 2,
    `tests/browser/canvas-*.test.ts`
  - Pan mode surviving a second drag in one session (F49)
    — Layer 2, `tests/browser/canvas-pan.test.ts`
  - The `if (ke.repeat) return` auto-repeat guard (F50) —
    Layer 1 if it is extracted as a pure predicate beside
    `nextCanvasTabIndex`, Layer 2 otherwise
  - Space on a focused node leaving pan mode off — the
    `defaultPrevented` handshake between the
    document-phase activation listener and the
    window-phase space handler (F57a) — Layer 2,
    `tests/browser/canvas-keyboard.test.ts`
  - The node panel's members fieldset — the alphabetical
    ordering of the HUMANS and AIs groups and the
    `<legend>Members</legend>` text (F58) — Layer 1,
    `tests/presenter-misc.test.ts`
  - The Create and Archive panels' shape — no
    `#prop-node-members`, no
    `#prop-node-attribute-picker` (F63, F64) — Layer 1,
    `assert.doesNotMatch` in
    `tests/presenter-misc.test.ts`
  - The picker filtering out already-referenced
    attributes (F68) — Layer 1, `buildNodePanel` with a
    node that references one of two
  - The rendered hazard badge — `<g
    class="flow-node-danger">` / `.flow-node-warning` and
    its `<title>` copy (F73) — Layer 1, `buildGraphSvg`;
    only the predicate is pinned
  - The Workbox page's title, subtitle, and tab shell
    text (WB1) — Layer 1 or 2; no presenter or browser
    test asserts the shell copy
  - `emptyStateFor`'s rendered copy (WB2) — Layer 1; it
    is unexported page glue in `web-app/workbox/index.ts`
  - The seeded completed-work-order count, 129 of 145
    across `buildWorkOrders()` and
    `buildLeadToCloseWorkload()` (WB3) — Layer 1, an
    exact-count test in the shape of
    `tests/mock-data-objectives.test.ts`, so a seed drift
    goes red instead of surprising a live count
  - The NOT READY row — its subtitle copy and
    `aria-disabled` (Layer 1; the adapter test pins
    `problemCount` and nothing connects that to the page
    glue's rendered string), and the click handler's
    `data-flow-id`-absence guard (Layer 2) (WB4, WB4a)
  - The collapsible toggle interaction and the
    relative-timestamp formatting (WB10) — Layer 2
  - The message plane's append-only invariant — no app
    code path mutates an existing pair (WB16, WB19) —
    Layer 1 in its closest expressible form: a test that
    attempts a mutation through the storage adapter's own
    API and asserts it is refused or impossible
  - Workbox data surviving a page navigation (WB17) —
    Layer 2
  - The second tab's rendered read-only, already-claimed
    view (WB18) — Layer 2
  - The client-side 412 recovery on the WORKBOX action
    screen — re-GET, conflict notice, warning toast, no
    auto-retry (WB19a) — Layer 1 first:
    `WorkboxDetailPresenter`'s own `conflictNotice`
    parameter carries no rendering test, unlike
    `RecordInstancesPresenter`'s; then Layer 2 for the
    live sequence
  - AI-only-member and zero-member node visibility in the
    inbox (WB20) — Layer 1; no fixture in
    `tests/workbox-inbox.test.ts` uses either
  - Archive-tab visibility being independent of which
    members the final transition referenced (WB21) —
    Layer 1; no fixture varies this
  - The stats page shell's absences — no left toolbar, no
    slide-in props panel, no marquee — and the pointer
    cursor over a node (FS1) — Layer 2, reading computed
    cursor style and confirming those elements are absent
    from the DOM; the `buildShell` test asserts what is
    present, never what is not
  - The live Stats-button and back-button navigation and
    the preserved `projectId` (FS2) — Layer 2; the back
    handler is inline in `web-app/flows/stats.ts`
  - The painted colour ramp — yellow/red hot, warm,
    cool/no-data (FS3) — Layer 2, reading the colour
    `--heat-t` resolves to
  - The hover and mouse-out wiring that opens and hides
    the stat card (Layer 2, inline in `flows/stats.ts`),
    and that card carrying no inputs and no Save button
    (Layer 1, over `FlowStatsPresenter.buildCard`'s
    output) (FS4)
  - Review's card subtitle naming its two seeded
    reviewers (FS4) — Layer 1, a `sharedMockDb()`-backed
    `getFlowStats` test on the real Customer Onboarding
    flow; `tests/mock-data-lead-to-close.test.ts` covers
    a different flow
  - The live click-to-pin, click-to-unpin, and re-pin
    transitions (FS5) — Layer 2; pin state is mutated
    inline in the click handler and only the
    `renderCard(container, null)` primitive is tested
  - Data Capture's two seeded members with an outgoing
    edge — the premise beneath FS6's "no triangle on any
    of the four nodes" (FS6) — Layer 1, the same
    `sharedMockDb()`-backed `getFlowStats` assertion FS4
    wants, extended to Data Capture. The composed hazard
    rules are pinned, but the seed shape they rest on was
    READ, not asserted, and
    `tests/mock-flow-readiness.test.ts` pins Customer
    Onboarding READY, which excludes zero-member and
    dead-end nodes but not the one-member `warning` case
  - The live click advancing the stepper, the accent
    stroke, and the dimmed opacity's painted ~30% (FS7) —
    Layer 2
  - The painted contrast of tints and card text in both
    themes (FS8) — Layer 2, toggling dark mode and
    reading computed contrast
  - The redirect to `flows/index.html` when `flowId` is
    absent (Layer 2; `init()` in `web-app/flows/stats.ts`
    is exported but untested) and the "Here now" WIP
    count agreeing with the Workbox's count for the same
    node (Layer 1 or 2, over one fixture) (FS9)
  - The Organization stat grid's "Next Billing" cell, and
    the Projects and Ideas stat CELLS specifically (G9) —
    Layer 1,
    `tests/presenter-projects-organization.test.ts`; the
    cited test decides Active People and a usage bar, and
    Projects and Ideas each render twice
  - The Organization edit form's prefill — the two inputs
    carrying the current Name and Domain as `value`
    attributes (G10) — Layer 1,
    `tests/presenter-projects-organization.test.ts`;
    nothing anywhere exercises `toGeneralInfoDraft`
    (`web-app/app/adapters/admin.ts:58`)
  - The sidebar member chip's click-to-profile navigation
    (G12) — Layer 2; `web-app/app/sidebar-member.ts`
    carries no test, and the browser tests read the
    chip's name only
  - The search match-fields — humans on name, email,
    title, or department; AIs on name or description and
    NOT provider or model (G13) — Layer 1, via
    `HumanMember.matchesSearch`; only "a term narrows the
    sections" is decided today
  - The AI dialog's "Model is required" toast-then-no-POST
    gate (G14, G14a) — Layer 1 or 2; `submitAIForm`
    (`web-app/members/index.ts`) carries no test
  - The Strengths card's read-to-edit tag-picker swap
    (G20) — Layer 1, a `.strength-chip` assertion on
    `HumanMemberDetailEditPresenter`; the cited test
    proves only that no State select renders
  - A Model-field edit persisting (G24b) — Layer 1;
    `aiDraft()` fixes `model` to `firstProviderModel().id`
    in both the seed and the update, so `'putAIMember
    updates the agent document'` never changes it
  - An event's `jti`, `parentJti`, `action`, and `at`
    reaching the presenter through one real adapter call
    (G25) — Layer 1; the adapter test asserts chain
    grouping and event counts only, and the presenter
    test that renders `parentJti` hand-builds its fixture
  - A `linked` provider badge distinct from `unlinked`
    (G26) — Layer 1, a scoped assertion in
    `presenter-identity-providers.test.ts`; `/linked/` is
    satisfied by the substring inside `'unlinked'`
  - The absence of a 3-pair composing POST on a human or
    AI edit (G41) — Layer 1, a spy on `ctx.POST` during
    `putHumanMember`/`putAIMember`; the cited tests prove
    the PUT lands, never that POST stays silent
  - The second-hop `IdentityPiiIntakeFailedError` toast
    and the error class itself (G44) — Layer 1; `grep -rn
    IdentityPiiIntakeFailedError tests/` is empty, though
    the torn-state mechanism it wraps is now pinned
  - The Erase PII button present for a person and absent
    for a service (G45) — Layer 1; neither
    `presenter-identity-detail.test.ts` fixture asserts
    `#identity-erase-btn` either way
  - The sent invitation row's "Invited {date}" sub-line
    and its state badge (V8) — Layer 1,
    `presenter-invitation-list.test.ts`; the
    `SentInvitationsPresenter` test asserts id, email, and
    Revoke only
  - The admin-only 403 on `GET
    organizations/:id/invitations/` for a non-admin caller
    (V9) — Layer 1; confirmed live by probe, but no test
    calls `getSentInvitations` as a non-admin
  - The not-found page's rendered message and link (H2) —
    Layer 2, a CDP test navigating to an unknown route
  - The live dark/light repaint — background, text, CSS
    custom properties — from a toggle click (I1, I3) —
    Layer 2; the CLI tests prove `data-theme` and icon
    state, never that the variables repaint
  - The theme choice actually persisting across a
    navigation or reload (I2, I5, FS8) — Layer 1,
    `tests/state-init.test.ts`; its `matchMedia` stub
    returns `matches: true`, which the module's own
    `'system'` default already satisfies, so the
    assertion holds with `initState()` never called.
    Flipping that one value to `false` closes it
  - `initState` hydrating a VALID stored
    `fusion-angle:sidebar-collapsed` value, and the
    `STORAGE_KEY_SIDEBAR` branch of the shared
    storage-event listener (I8, I28) — Layer 1,
    `tests/state-init.test.ts` (only the corrupt-value
    rejection is tested) and a sidebar sibling of
    `tests/state-theme-icon.test.ts`'s cross-tab test
  - `.mobile-header` going hidden again after the
    viewport is restored to ≥768px (I10) — Layer 2, one
    more assertion beside the `#desktop-sidebar` restore
    check in `tests/browser/viewport.test.ts`
  - The whole mobile drawer — hamburger open, backdrop
    and nav-link close, Escape close, and the Tab focus
    trap (I11–I15) — Layer 2; `initMobileDrawer`
    (`web-app/app/mobile-drawer.ts`) carries no test but
    `tests/browser/viewport.test.ts`'s breakpoint check,
    a different concern
  - The command palette's Cmd+K / Ctrl+K binding, Escape
    close, and arrow-key and Enter navigation (I16, I18,
    I19) — Layer 2; `tests/command-palette-init.test.ts`
    is a does-not-throw smoke test and the key-index
    logic is unexported inside the DOM listeners
  - The loading skeleton before a fetch settles (I21) —
    Layer 2, probing before `wait_for_load`; Layer 1 is
    possible by reading `innerHTML` between calling
    `loadInto` and awaiting it
  - The toast's top-center position and its ~6-second
    auto-dismiss (I23) — Layer 2, reading computed
    position and waiting out `TOAST_DURATION_MS`
  - The newest-on-top `prepend` order and the
    specifically OLDEST toast being the one evicted at
    the cap (I25) — Layer 2; today's browser test raises
    toasts with identical text, so it cannot tell which
    one was removed
  - The skip link's tab order and its focus destination
    on Enter (Layer 2), and the single `<main
    id="main-content">` landmark (Layer 1, a static scan
    of `web-app/app/components-layout.html`) (I29)
  - The wildcard `::view-transition-group(*)` and
    `::view-transition-old/new(*)` selectors carrying
    `animation: none` inside the reduced-motion block
    (I30) — Layer 1, one more `block.includes(...)`
    assertion in `tests/base-css-motion.test.ts`
  - The objectives presenter's render ORDER — the active
    list in position order (K1) and the Archived
    sub-section sitting under Active (K4) — Layer 1,
    `tests/presenter-organization-objectives.test.ts`;
    its assertions are unscoped `.includes()` calls that
    prove presence, not order
  - `postObjectiveRevision`, the rename write (K3) —
    Layer 1; no test anywhere calls it
  - Reactivation returning an objective to the active
    list as a live transition (K5) — Layer 1; the
    presenter fixture feeds static active and archived
    arrays
  - The `sent_back` branch of baseline-slider editability
    (K9) — Layer 1; only `under_review` is exercised,
    though the code path is shared
  - The project action bar's per-state button set —
    Decline and Send back present on `sent_back`, the
    View history button (`data-action="view-history"`)
    present at all (K16, K30) and absent where the case
    says so (K9), and no Score button or modal at
    `under_review` (K10) — Layer 1,
    `tests/presenter-project-action-bar.test.ts`
    fixtures for the states nothing feeds;
    `buildReviewActions` and `buildLifecycleActions` are
    different methods and only some states are covered
  - Dirty-tracking resetting after Save and staying reset
    across a re-render (K14) — Layer 1; no test renders,
    saves, and re-renders in sequence
  - The no-payload-save guard — an unmoved slider never
    calls `postProjectBaselineScoring` (K18) — Layer 1
  - The actual slider's own `value` attribute pre-filling
    with the latest actual (K21) — Layer 1, extracting
    that attribute and asserting on it; `'shows latest
    actual with sign'` searches the whole rendered blob,
    where the ASCII form is a tautology against every
    slider's `min="-100"`
  - The absent visible text label on the column header
    (K24) — Layer 1
  - Green-for-positive and red-for-negative on the gauge
    (K28) — Layer 1, asserting the colour inside each
    side's OWN `<linearGradient>`; the tri-gradient test
    confirms all three stops appear somewhere across four
    gradients, and swapping `gauge.ts:108-110`'s
    assignment keeps the suite green
  - The always-present muted `gauge-arc-track` at every
    value, including zero and undefined, and the actual
    tick's visual distinctness from the baseline area
    (K28) — Layer 1 in `gauge.ts`, or a DESIGN-SYSTEM CSS
    check
  - `subscribeProjectScoreChanges` /
    `notifyProjectScoreChange` (K29) — Layer 2, a two-tab
    BroadcastChannel test
  - The production temporal-name resolver (K7, K30) — an
    inline, unexported closure in
    `web-app/projects/detail.ts` that the presenter's
    fixture hand-duplicates rather than imports; Layer 1
    once it is extracted as a named pure function
  - `RecordListPresenter` and `RecordPresenter`
    (`web-app/app/presenters/record-list.ts`) carry ZERO
    tests — the sidebar Records entry, its live
    navigation, and the org-scoped list's contents,
    Customer Profile visible and Project Brief hidden
    (R1), and the "Record archived" toast
    with the Archived chip beside Active,
    numeric-count-free chips, and the toggle hiding the
    card (R15) — Layer 1, a new
    `tests/presenter-records-list.test.ts`
  - The whole record edit-mode form — name and
    description inputs, per-attribute rows, type picker,
    options textarea, constraint editor, add and remove
    attribute, and the absent drag handle (R4–R9) — Layer
    1; `RecordDetailEditPresenter`, `recordDraftFromView`,
    `allowedConstraintKinds`, and `formatConstraint`
    (`web-app/app/presenters/record-detail.ts`) are all
    exported and all untested
  - Returning to read mode after Save, and the rendered
    constraint summaries (R10) — Layer 1, a new
    `tests/records-detail-reduce.test.ts` mirroring
    `tests/projects-detail-reduce.test.ts`
  - The toast-stack cap and the re-entrant-save guard for
    Record edits specifically (R10a) — Layer 2, a new
    `tests/browser/records.test.ts` in the spirit of
    `tests/browser/toasts.test.ts`
  - The flow header's painted "Record: Customer Profile"
    dropdown and its selected state (R11) — Layer 2
  - The node panel's whole attribute ref-row rendering
    (R12) — Layer 1; `buildAttributeRefRow`
    (`web-app/app/presenters/flow-designer-view.ts`) is
    exported and untested
  - The workbox action screen's empty-required pre-check
    and its toast text (R13) — Layer 1;
    `hasEmptyRequiredAttribute`
    (`web-app/workbox/detail.ts`) is a pure function one
    `export` away from a direct test
  - A radio-option submit recording the chosen value
    through a transition (R14a) — Layer 1, a `radio`-typed
    case in `tests/adapters-record-transitions.test.ts`;
    the option-membership check in
    `api/record-constraints.ts` is exercised by nothing
  - `instanceListItems`
    (`web-app/app/presenters/record-detail.ts:120`) —
    Layer 1, zero tests; it builds the
    id-plus-readable-values projection
    `records/detail.ts:147` reads for R16's Instances
    list
  - The exact conflict-notice text (R17, R19) — Layer 1,
    importing `INSTANCE_CONFLICT_NOTICE` in
    `tests/presenter-record-instances.test.ts` instead of
    asserting a hand-typed literal
  - The mock seed's actual absence of any custom
    attribute ACL (R21) — Layer 1, a
    `read_roles`/`write_roles` default assertion in
    `tests/mock-data-records.test.ts`; without it a
    future seed adding `read_roles: ['admin']` makes
    R21's live default-ACL check read FAIL on healthy
    product with nothing red first
  - `crank`'s termination trap — a signal stopping the
    live `crank` and its child `./serve`, and the temp
    bundle removed afterward (J1, J2) — Layer 1,
    extending `tests/crank-cli.test.ts` past its
    docker-stub early abort
  - The `Secure` cookie attribute (SV3) — Layer 1, one
    `assert.match(cookie, /Secure/i)` in
    `tests/api-authentication-token.test.ts`;
    `api/authentication.ts` sets it and nothing checks it
  - `localStorage` holding neither
    `fusion-angle:authorization` nor `refresh_token`
    during a real cookie session (SV3) — Layer 2, reading
    `localStorage` after sign-in
  - `bootAuthGate`'s cookie-session branch
    (`cookieRefreshAndInstall` / `isCookieSession`)
    firing on a real reload (SV4) — Layer 2, reloading a
    signed-in page and confirming no bounce; only the
    server-side refresh grant is pinned
  - The ideas page's populated-list cross-tab re-render —
    `onIdeasLoaded`'s own `subscribeIdeaChanges` call
    (SV8b) — Layer 1, extending
    `tests/ideas-empty-subscribe.test.ts` with a
    non-empty initial load that still hears the bell;
    only the empty-list re-init branch is decided, and
    the walk never reaches it
  - The pre-navigation staleness itself (SV10) — Layer 2,
    a third test in `tests/browser/two-jars.test.ts`: B
    sits on `ideas/`, A writes, B's DOM is unchanged
    until B navigates
- The gap list above is the 2026-08-29 audit catalogs'
  output, not an exhaustive sweep of TEST-PLAN.md's own
  `exploratory` clauses. Thirteen purely-exploratory
  cases no catalog listed are its known residue — AA3,
  B4, B5, B12, B13, B14, G22, G23, G23a, G38, G39, G42,
  and I27. Several are species already filed above: G22,
  G23, G23a, G38, G39, and G42 each say in their own
  `Pin:` that the page module carries no CLI or browser
  test, exactly as G12 does; I27 is A5's
  console-and-network covenant on a longer path; B4 and
  B14 are static auth-page copy, decidable by the markup
  test F4 wants. F2 is exploratory too and is NOT residue
  — it is retired, PASS vacuously. Once the audit
  workspace is gone, those thirteen `Pin:` clauses in
  TEST-PLAN.md are the only record of them
- The Send Back feedback textarea is discarded.
  `web-app/app/presenters/idea.ts:410-425` renders
  `<textarea id="approval-send-back-feedback">` in the
  Send Back dialog, and `grep -rn
  "approval-send-back-feedback" web-app/ api/ shared/
  tests/ server/` returns zero reads: the confirm path
  (`web-app/ideas/detail.ts:289-296` → `transitionIdea`
  → `postIdeaStateChange`) has no feedback parameter, so
  whatever a reviewer types is thrown away. Found by
  reading, not driving, during the 2026-08-29 audit; no
  TEST-PLAN case claims the feedback survives. Oracle: a
  Layer 1 test asserting the typed feedback reaches the
  transition
- Two corrupted upstream identifiers, from an old
  id-scrubber. One is a test NAME —
  `tests/presenter-projects-organization.test.ts:398`
  says `XXZruirZyAOoRpNxaDnpSA` where it means
  `current/limit` — and a TEST-PLAN pin quotes it
  faithfully (`TEST-PLAN.md:4382`), so the name is fixed
  first and the pin follows in the same commit. The other
  is a local variable standing for `r1` at four sites in
  `tests/api-invitations-fence.test.ts` (:360, :363,
  :505, :509) — `rOEPOcVMQdJiiiMuiiEhlg`, quoted by no
  pin, so it renames alone
- A stale manual-coverage pointer —
  `tests/flow-designer-presenter.test.ts:352` points its
  comment at "TEST-PLAN F51"; the locked-members case is
  F62
- Two dormant seed map entries still carry the deleted
  slice seeder's identity `dtmZgnDBlVcoyjxKzlaKgA`
  ('g-unseated') — `api/mock-data.ts:204`
  (`SEED_PASSWORD_CREDENTIAL_BY_IDENTITY`) and
  `api/mock-data/seed-hash-preimage.ts:175`. Pruning
  them was out of the three-layers spec's scope
- K's preamble detects a stranded active org by the
  literal string "Wayne Enterprises", but G40 renames
  that org before K1 runs, so the switcher shows neither
  name and the detection no longer recognizes the state
  it exists to catch. A name-independent check (an org
  id or seat comparison) closes it — TEST-PLAN.md
  `## K. Objectives & Scoring` preamble, TEST-PLAN.md G40
- Undo at the stack bottom returns 201 — `api/derive-flows.ts`
  computes `hasUndoHistory` as `pairs > 1`, so the first undo
  past the bottom is accepted instead of refused. Named by
  the 2026-08-29 three-layers audit; observed in the F
  undo/redo cases. Oracle: a Layer 1 test in
  `tests/flow-operations.test.ts` asserting the bottom-of-stack
  undo is refused.
- The first click after a page reload only focuses the window
  — every driven case must click twice after a reload. Named
  by the 2026-08-29 three-layers audit and carried as a
  driving note in TEST-PLAN.md's `## The walk`. Oracle: a
  Layer 2 test under `tests/browser/` asserting one click
  after reload reaches the element.

## Sequencing

- 8 → 6 (the chat clause consumes chats)
- 5 → 10 (the health probe consumes `/status`)
- Item 3's token-at-rest hashing and physical PII
  erasure close their KNOWN seams — the closer removes
  the ARCHITECTURE.md bullet and this file's line in
  one commit
- The profile document precedes the roster-profile and
  `DEFAULT_DIM` bullets
- The mock-seed anchor bullet activates after
  2026-09-13
- The Deno specs run strictly 1 → 6 (3 and 4 may swap
  after Spec 2's measurements; Spec 6 optional)
- `api/derive-states.ts:811-823` (claim-expiry as its
  own event) lands before any multi-process deployment

## Close protocol

The pin flips red → fix the test to the new truth (or
delete it if the old incomplete behavior is gone) →
remove the bullet here → remove the named comment at
its `file:line` → for a KNOWN seam, remove the
ARCHITECTURE.md bullet in the same commit → AUDIT.md's
`m` is the new seam count.
