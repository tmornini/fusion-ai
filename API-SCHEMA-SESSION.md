Take a look at this URI schema.

Please analyze how this fits into the applications's state needs, what verbs need to be implemented, what's missing, etc.

Know that every entity will be kept in a backend structured in this way: ~/.claude/plans/go-to-church-binary-stonebraker.md.

That mechanism will replace the existing ledger's and common states system by moving said state into each message stored message.
