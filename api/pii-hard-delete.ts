// THE /pii HARD-DELETE ZONE (Phase 10 Task 3, gate 4). The
// shadow ledger is append-only everywhere else it is read
// (Commandment VI) — `identities/:id/pii` is the ONE sanctioned
// exception: a single-slot register where every write (PUT or
// DELETE) physically REMOVES whatever pair occupies the slot
// before appending its own, so the slot always holds exactly
// ONE pair — a PUT pair (the PII document) or a DELETE pair (the
// bodyless erasure tombstone: evidence of erasure without
// erased content). Supersession and erasure are the SAME
// mechanism here. `replacePiiSlot` is THE ONLY code path that
// deletes rows from `requests` or `responses` — grep-provable;
// keep it that way. The address is CHAINLESS by construction:
// `identities/:id/pii` is retired from `DOCUMENT_CLASS_ROUTE_
// PATTERNS` (message-pair.ts), so the gate's own head-read never
// runs for it and every /pii pair forms with neither Supersedes
// nor Follows — a stored provenance pointer at a removed pair
// would be a stored lie.
//
// THE SINGLE-AUTHORITATIVE-ID-SET RULE (a binding verification
// finding): the pairs occupying the slot are enumerated by ONE
// scan — `requests.getAllWhere('uri_prefix', ...)` — and THAT
// id-set alone is deleted from BOTH tables. `responses` is NEVER
// re-scanned independently and trusted to agree: two independent
// scans could disagree (a pre-existing torn pair, a mid-flight
// anomaly), and reconciling them defensively would be Internal
// Defense over a covenant this function alone must keep. Deriving
// both deletions from ONE id-set structurally preserves the
// orphan-pair balance (`requests.length === responses.length`,
// asserted throughout the shadow-ledger suite) and guarantees
// this zone never MANUFACTURES a torn pair — a pre-existing one
// still surfaces on its own terms, via `storedResponseFor`'s
// `responses.getById` throwing `EntityNotFoundError` rather than
// silently reading as a missing replay (message-pair.ts).
//
// Runs INSIDE the caller's own transaction — both callers
// (`postIdentityPiiDocumentOp`'s PUT, the `identities/:id/pii`
// DELETE closure, api/routes.ts) already open
// `['identity_pii', 'requests', 'responses']`; row ops only, per
// the IndexedDB auto-commit constraint (a transaction body may
// await only row ops, never crypto or a timer) — `pair` arrives
// fully formed, all crypto done pre-tx (message-pair.ts).
//
// Cross-tab note: the localStorage demo tier flushes a
// transaction's touched keys as a multi-key buffer, not a single
// atomic write — the accepted B4 last-writer-wins class this
// codebase already carries for that tier. Real IndexedDB
// serializes overlapping-scope readwrite transactions, so two
// tabs racing the SAME /pii address there still resolve to
// exactly one genuine winner — the single-slot invariant holds
// for real, not merely by convention.
