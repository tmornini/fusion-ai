// reach first, so registerDocumentFamilyWiring below is safe to
// call at module scope. (An earlier attempt that left
// param/requireOrganization/withoutId here, calling

    // pair above (a fresh address, genesis), the idea's head-
    // read finds its prior pair, so this one records Supersedes
    // provenance. This closes the standing watch-point: before
    // this task, a converted idea's derived history MISSED its
    // 'promoted' event because no pair recorded it. Phase 7

    // its project-nested address (projects/:id/objective-
    // baseline-scores/:sid) — every baseline id is client-
    // minted FRESH per conversion, so these are genesis like
