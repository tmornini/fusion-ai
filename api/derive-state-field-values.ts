// Phase 14 Task 6: state_field_values (SFV) truth, derived from
// the pair plane instead of read off its own table. Author gate
// 5's own census, re-run at Step 0 and unchanged: the row plane
// has exactly ONE writer, postWorkOrderTransitionOp (api/
// routes.ts) — it folds every field-value row for a transition
// into that SAME transaction's state_field_values.put calls,
// alongside ONE transition OPERATION pair (work-orders/:id/
// transition) whose body carries the fold (fieldValues: [{id,
// fields}]) — no per-value pair of its own. The STANDALONE leaf
// address (states/:id/field-values/:fvid) is BOTH PAIR_WIRED and
// DOCUMENT_CLASS (message-pair.ts), so a direct leaf PUT/DELETE —
// live OR seeded (api/mock-data/seed-message-pairs.ts pair-wires
// every mock row the same way) — DOES pair-wire itself.
//
// ELECTED (a) TWO-SOURCE UNION (spec B2) over (b) close-the-gap:
// zero ledger growth. The union is EXACT, not approximate — the
// row plane's own writers are exhaustively these two addresses
// (nothing else ever calls state_field_values.put), so every row
// the table could ever hold has a pair on one of these two
// addresses.
//
// DELETION REPRODUCED, NOT RESURRECTED: the leaf address is
// DOCUMENT_CLASS, so its own DELETE pair IS the tombstone signal
// — head-reduced away below exactly as deriveDocumentsAt (derive-
// documents.ts) excludes a DELETE head. A row born from a
// transition and LATER revised or deleted through the standalone
// leaf address is head-reduced by the SAME (at, id) order across
// BOTH sources (latestByKey below), so the leaf write — which can
// only ever land strictly after its own originating transition —
// wins, exactly as the row plane's own re-PUT/DELETE already
// works. No second pair gap.

//   - Leaf family (states/:id/field-values/): no cheaper
//     entity-id source exists. A leaf pair's own uri_prefix is
//     keyed by state_event_id (api/message-address.ts), and
//     nothing enumerates "every state event that might carry a
//     field value" more cheaply than reading the plane that
//     would answer it.
//   - Transition family (work-orders/:id/transition/): WOULD be
//     servable via N indexed requests/responses.getAllWhere
//     ('uri_prefix', ...) reads (api/db.ts's TABLE_INDEXES: both
//     tables index uri_prefix — an EXACT-match index, one value
//     per entity, not a family-wide constant), one per known
//     work-order id, EXCEPT the only cheap work-order id source
//     — view.workOrders.getAll() — is an EntityStore read, which
//     applies its OWN deleted-filter (getDeletedIdsIn,
//     store-entity.ts) and silently excludes a since-deleted
//     work order. The OLD table-plane state_field_values read
//     never filtered by work-order lifecycle at all (a field-
//     value row survives its work order's own deletion), so
//     scoping by view.workOrders.getAll() would introduce a
//     genuine wire delta — dropping a since-deleted work order's
//     field-value history from the RESTRICT count — not merely
//     miss an optimization. Rejected for that reason; no
//     DbAdapter-level primitive enumerates work-order ids
//     WITHOUT the deleted filter today.
// Task 11 measures this; closing the transition half would need
// a raw, undeleted-filtered work-order id enumeration this task
// does not introduce on its own authority.
