// The states-log derivation, Phase 11 (the derive-identity-
// spine.ts precedent applied to the unified event log). SIX
// sources feed the union deriveStates/deriveStatesFor assemble
// (Task 5, at the bottom of this file):
//   (a) deriveEventPairStates — the states/:id event-pair reader
//       (gate 5a).
//   (b) the four trio families' OWN embedded lifecycle history —
//       deriveIdeaStateHistory/deriveProjectStateHistory/
//       deriveRecordStateHistory/deriveFlowStateHistory, IMPORTED
//       from their own modules (gate 5b) via deriveTrioFamilyStates
//       below, never rebuilt here.
//   (c) deriveMemberGenesis — the human/AI member create-op
//       genesis trio (gate 5c).
//   (d) deriveWorkOrderLifecycle — the work-order op-pair replay
//       (gate 5d) — see its own section header below for the
//       work-order-specific edges.
//   (e) deriveFlowGraphStates — flow-node/edge deleted/restored
//       sidecars (gate 5e).
//   (f) deriveInvitationStates — the invitation grant + its three
//       answering ops (gate 5f).
// Objectives need no seventh source: their archive/reactivate ride
// states/:id pairs like any other entity's (source (a) already
// covers them), and a fresh objective has no genesis event at all
// — absence IS active (api/routes.ts's postObjectiveCreationOp
// comment) — so there is no genesis row to derive anywhere.
//
// The PAIR-PLANE org fence (resolveOwningOrganization /
// fenceStatesByOwner, gate 4) is applied ONCE, by deriveStates
// alone — deriveStatesFor takes both the organization and the
// entity from the caller directly, so no visibility fence applies
// there.
//
// FLIPPED (Task 7): api/routes.ts's GET /states and GET
// /entity-states/:id/history dispatch to deriveStates/
// deriveStatesFor below — Task 1's row-plane fence
// (api/store-parent-scoped.ts) no longer serves either read.
// GET /states/:id and GET /entity-states/:id stay on the row
// plane — zero product callers, deferred to Phase Final.
//
// THE GATE-15 PRECEDENT (Phase 10, tests/drift-identities.test.ts
// + api/routes.ts's module-private membershipsAcrossAllOrganiza
// tions/ownerOrganizationViaMembershipPairPlane): an org fence can
// be reproduced from the MEMBERSHIP PAIR PLANE instead of row
// probes. This module reproduces that same technique for the
// states log's own fence — resolveViaMembershipPairPlane below is
// re-derived here (not imported) because routes.ts's helpers are
// module-private.
//
// IMMUNE TO THE DELETED FILTER: requests/responses are append-
// only, so a family's document pair still names its organization
// (via the stored uri_prefix, or — for invitations — the stored
// body) forever, regardless of whether the ENTITY it addresses
// has since transitioned to a 'deleted' lifecycle state. Task 1's
// row-plane fence had to bypass EntityStore's deleted filter with
// a raw row read to get this same guarantee
// (rawOrganizationOwnedProbes); the pair plane needs no such
// bypass — it never consults the states log's deleted-filter at
// all.
//
// THE isVisible RULE REPRODUCED (api/store-parent-scoped.ts): a
// row is visible to `boundOrganization` iff its resolved owner IS
// `boundOrganization`, or the owner is null (a genuine orphan — no
// pair anywhere names the entity). fenceStatesByOwner below is the
// exact same three-way rule, applied over resolveOwningOrganization
// instead of a row-plane probe.

// ---- deriveEventPairStates — the event-pair reader (gate 5a) ---

// states/:id is an EVENT-APPEND address (message-pair.ts): each
// event id is client-minted fresh per write, and the states table
// is ledger-immutable (StateStore.put throws
// LedgerImmutabilityError on a differing re-put of the same id),
// so a given uriId is visited by AT MOST one distinct 2xx pair —
// documentPairsAt's full pair list IS the event list; no head
// reduction is needed or appropriate.
//
// SEGMENT-BOUNDARY CORRECTNESS (the derive-identity-spine.ts E13
// precedent): 'states' is organization-nested
// (message-pair.ts's ORGANIZATION_NESTED_FIRST_SEGMENTS), so a
// live write's stored uri_prefix is

// deriveEventPairStates (source a) already covers. Every SEEDED
// work order (buildWorkOrders/buildLeadToCloseWorkload) was

// document plus a live claim) draws its births from source (a)

// row is ever double-counted across the two readers.
//
// THE CREATE-PAIR RELAXATION (EDGE 1): a work order's create pair

// orders lack one (they were never created through this route), so

// replay instead compares the claim pair's own body `claimAt`

// boundary (isExpiredAsOf below) — a PURE, Date.now-free
// comparator, deliberately never isClaimEventExpired (api/

// replay holds ONLY under this demo's zero-latency, single-process

// Source (f) of the states-log union. An invitation's own states
// never ride the states/:id address (source a) — the invitations
// side channel forms its own operation pairs at the flat
// '/invitations/' collection (the grant) and at
// 'invitations/:id/<op>/' (the three answering ops), api/
// invitations-domain.ts's own formWritePair/formInvitationOpPair
// calls. Deliberately NOT built atop deriveInvitations/
// invitationOpStates (api/derive-invitations.ts) — both resolve
// only a RESOLVED CURRENT STATE and DISCARD the event id and
// member_id a StateEntity row needs (the brief's own NOTE) — this
// is a fresh, StateEntity-emitting extraction over the SAME two
// address families, never a retrofit of either.
//
// THE GRANT'S OWN DUPLICATE-ECHO (grantInvitation, api/invitations-
// domain.ts): an ALREADY-pending (org, identity) pair still forms
// its OWN operation pair at whatever invitationId the SECOND
// caller submitted (the 'existing' outcome branch) — but writes
// NEITHER a states event NOR a document there. Cross-referencing
// against the invitation's DOCUMENT plane (formed ONLY on the
// 'fresh' outcome, at the SAME invitationId) excludes that phantom
// pair: a document exists at an id iff its grant operation pair
// genuinely posted 'pending'.
//
// THE ANSWERING OPS' OWN NO-OP RESENDS (accept/decline/revoke):
// each is idempotent on its OWN already-reached terminal state (a
// re-accept/re-decline/re-revoke still forms an operation pair but
// posts NO event) — mutual exclusivity across the three op KINDS
// is the domain gate's own covenant (derive-invitations.ts's
// header), so at most one op kind ever succeeds per invitation,
// but THAT kind can still accumulate repeat pairs. Since
// appendMessagePair mints each pair's response `at` synchronously
// inside its own (serialized) transaction, the group's
// chronologically EARLIEST (at, id) pair is always the one that
// found the invitation still 'pending' and genuinely posted the
// event — operationPairsAt already returns each group (at, id)
// ascending, so its first entry is that pair.
