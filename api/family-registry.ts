// The per-family registry: the single source of truth for a
// family's cross-cutting properties — organization-nesting
// tier, PUT concurrency class, and create-address body field —
// that Phase 1 spread across parallel literal tables in
// message-pair.ts (ORGANIZATION_NESTED_FIRST_SEGMENTS,
// CREATE_BODY_ID_FIELDS). Ideas is the FIRST registered family
// (Phase 2 Task 1); each later family's registration retires
// its OWN entries from those literals, never both at once — a
// registered family answers ONLY from here.
//
// The standing rule: this registry is the single source of
// family wiring. Slots grow only on per-family evidence — two
// instances are coincidence, three is pattern — never ahead of
// it. Aspirational families (policy, transform, ownership,
// among others) wait for their own demand before a slot, a
// registration, or a helper is added on their behalf.
