// owning org from a parent / the membership ledger at READ time
// (`api/store-parent-scoped.ts`); only the global identity/auth
// spine and the organizations directory pass straight through,
// with route guards fencing the directory and credential
// secrets. The scoped set is enumerated explicitly — no
// reflective "wrap everything" — so it stays reviewable, and a

// `base` is a class instance (private backend, prototype
// methods), so it cannot be spread; the lifecycle methods
// arrow-delegate to keep `this` bound to `base`.

// is only as strong as the token whose verified `org` claim
// feeds the guard, and that HMAC key is still client-shipped.
// Do not rely on tenant isolation in a networked / multi-user
// context until the signing key lives server-side.
